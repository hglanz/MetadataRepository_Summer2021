"9","Advantages and Drawbacks of Using Waist Trainers","History with Pros and Cons of Waist Training You must have heard about the hype of waist training and the superstars who talked about it. But the question arises what precisely waist training is? Waist training is basically the process of modifying body structure through wearing narrowing garments for instance corset or shapewear. They help in reducing the size of one’s waistline and make it a shape like hourglass. Sometimes steel boned corsets are numerous reasons and situations. As no product is centred nor beneficial neither it’s totally wrong. Same case applies with the waist trainers. Medical community doesn’t like to recommend the use of waist trainers. There are both benefits and risks involved with every product in the market. Numerous people in the medical community don’t appreciate the use of waist trainers, because some males and females aren't able to use them properly. Nonetheless, you should always opt to select the right waist trainer in your mundane routine and the optimal results are achieved on proper usage by adopting certain principles.  A Precise History of Waist Cinching Waist cinching or Waist training became popular in the 1900s firstly in Europe and then in the United State of America. Waist trainers were encouraged by the creation of the corset, which was later switched by the belts. In the beginning of this product’s invention it was used to wear outside the clothing and considered as a fashion statement. As the passage of time and practice of waist trainers grew remarkably popular, women started to wear belts and cinchers as undergarments, specifically in the times of flapper era where women looked-for a boyish, youthful figure and searched for Best Waist Trainer for Women. No doubt these Shape wears are still in vogue today. Recently celebrities and models have recently started endorsing these undergarments in numbers and which grab the attention of ladies and girls in numbers. Pros & Cons of Wearing Waist Trainers People wonder, does the Best Waist Trainer for Women lose fat from their waist? Answer is no corset, shape cincher or shapewear can supernaturally shrink your level of body fat. With proper dieting and exercises you may see wonders. Basically when you start wearing waist trainers you consistently get the results. You can visibly notice losing weight and you are going to develop more into an hourglass, more snatched waist rather than straight waist. But it definitely takes time. So after you achieve the waist that you want because you will and if you are consistent and have a good diet and proper fitness routine then you will surely get to your goals. Once you will achieve that you can then not wear the waist trainer as much so. Now what happens is the body will stay the same way as it is. But it does need some reinforcement every once in a while. You can now wear the shaper once in a week or twice to maintain the body shape. If you completely stop wearing it then the shape you maintain after wearing that might go, weight may not be put on but shape can be hurt. Shape can go back to a straight figure rather than an hourglass figure waisttrainerdepot.com/. So keep that in mind that waist trainers don’t work but this is just how they work. Remember they are in place and they mold to your body and create your body to what you desire. It takes waist trainers to be effective. So if not wearing it occasionally anymore can give your body the unfold and unmold figure again the way it was.","Arts and Humanities; Engineering",NA,"2021-07-14","johnysins, johnysins - ORCID:","No records found.","johnysins, johnysins, 2021, ""Advantages and Drawbacks of Using Waist Trainers"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WEZJYK, Harvard Dataverse, V1","NA","NA","NA","NA"

Dypsnea is a subjective, multifactorial symptom that has been proven difficult to measure. The current subjective measures of dyspnea fail to meet criteria suggested for use in multi-national clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to develop, validate and translate into multiple languages a measure of dyspnea for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) that more readily meets the criteria for large clinical trials. The Yount et al. study examined the psychometric performance of two IRT measures of dyspnea and related functional limitations in patients with COPD and simulated computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of the banks to determine the number of questions required to achieve high precision. The Choi et al. study reports the development of an item bank for dyspnea severity and related functional limitations on the basis of a PRO conceptual framework derived from patient input.

"23","Replication Data for Commodity Shocks and Incumbency Effects","Why do incumbents enjoy an electoral advantage in some political settings but suffer from a disadvantage in others? We propose a novel explanation linking variation in incumbency effects with exogenous commodity shocks. While voters attempt to sanction incumbents for economic performance, changes in commodity prices affect their evaluations and condition the electoral fortunes of incumbents vis-à-vis challengers. We test our argument in Brazilian municipalities, combining a plausibly exogenous measure of variation in commodity prices with a close election regression discontinuity design. Our results show that increases in the price of agricultural commodities greatly enhance the prospects of incumbents, while negative shocks exacerbate their incumbency disadvantage, especially in rural municipalities. Further investigation suggests that commodity shocks do not operate via voter learning about candidate quality, changes in the pool of candidates, shifts in voter preferences, or strategic elite investments. Instead, we find suggestive evidence that commodity shocks affect voters’ evaluations through their effect on local economic growth.

"25","Replication Data for: Financing party branches: Evidence from the German federal system","Adequately financed branches contribute to the integration of regional interests into statewide parties. Yet, we have limited knowledge about the determinants of branches’ varying income levels in federal contexts. To address this shortage, this article elucidates why branches receive donations from citizens and businesses to different degrees. I hypothesise that party competition at the state level, the difference in regional economic performance and parties’ historical legacies can account for the level of branches’ donation revenue. Analysing German statewide party branches’ income from 2009 to 2017, this study finds support for the facilitating impact of state and federal electoral contests on donation levels. Regional economic disparities, by contrast, only marginally affect donation revenues. At the same time, parties’ path-dependent developments help explain asymmetries in average revenue levels between western and eastern branches. The study’s findings suggest that intense regional party competition contributes to branches’ financial independence within the statewide party organisation.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-13","Jacob, Marc (ETH Zürich) - ORCID: 0000-0001-8267-1956","Preview                                                                    Access File                                        File Access                  Public                        Download Options                                                 Plain Text                            Download Metadata                     Data File Citation        EndNote XML                        RIS                        BibTeX                                            Explore Options                                 Read Text","Jacob, Marc, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Financing party branches: Evidence from the German federal system"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/97EDVS, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:8T5hIoZeuyDN24Sajj+lew== [fileUNF]","c(""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(16, 8, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(791, 800, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"

"28","Construction of Hyperoxia Microenvironment for Activation of Ferroptosis in Radiotherapy","Apoptosis dysregulation is an important mechanism responsible for the intrinsic and acquired resistances of melanoma, which necessitates the exploration of oncological treatments to activate non-apoptotic cell deaths. Herein, we engineered photosynthesis microcapsules (PMCs) for creating hyperoxia microenvironment and induction of ferroptosis in melanoma based on the discovery of radiation-hyperoxia induced lipid peroxidation (RHILP). The PMCs were constructed by encapsulation of cyanobacteria and upconversion nanoparticles in alginate microcapsules for photosynthesis in chloroplast, which was driven by red light converted from bio-transparent near infrared II photons. Combination of PMCs and X rays evoked a RHILP effect and ferroptosis in melanoma cells and xenografts, as evidenced by ferrous ion release into cytoplasm, glutathione depletion, and suppression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Consequently, X ray-hyperoxia treatment improved the survival rate of melanoma-bearing mice and suppressed tumor metastases. Overall, our findings provide opportunities to overcome melanoma resistances and will inspire the exploration of oncological treatments.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",NA,"2021-07-01","Jiang, Jun (Soochow University)","Figure 6                                                         7Z Archive - 107.7 MB                Published Jul 1, 2021                0 Downloads                    MD5: 71dd2cd526d916b60a9d1dfb910f5ad6                                Validation of ferroptosis in tumor tissue","Jiang, Jun, 2021, ""Construction of Hyperoxia Microenvironment for Activation of Ferroptosis in Radiotherapy"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WV8AV7, Harvard Dataverse, V3","c(""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"
