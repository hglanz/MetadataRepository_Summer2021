"2","Low-altitude aerial imagery obtained with unmanned aerial systems (UAS) flights over Black Beach, Falmouth, Massachusetts on 18 March 2016 (JPEG images)","Imagery acquired with unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and coupled with structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry can produce high-resolution topographic and visual reflectance datasets that rival or exceed lidar and orthoimagery. These new techniques are particularly useful for data collection of coastal systems, which requires high temporal and spatial resolution datasets. The U.S. Geological Survey worked in collaboration with members of the Marine Biological Laboratory and Woods Hole Analytics at Black Beach, in Falmouth, Massachusetts to explore scientific research demands on UAS technology for topographic and habitat mapping applications. This project explored the application of consumer-grade UAS platforms as a cost-effective alternative to lidar and aerial/satellite imagery to support coastal studies requiring high-resolution elevation or remote sensing data. A small UAS was used to capture low-altitude photographs and GPS devices were used to survey reference points. These data were processed in an SfM workflow to create an elevation point cloud, an orthomosaic image, and a digital elevation model.","August 7, 2020","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","aerial-images                        aerial-photography                        airborne-imagery                        atlantic-ocean                        barnstable                        black-beach                        buzzards-bay                        cape-cod                        cmgp                        coastal-and-marine-...                        dji-phantom-3                        drone                        falmouth                        field-activity-numb...                        geospatial-datasets                        great-sippewissett-...                        great-sippewissett-...                        ground-control-point                        jpeg-images                        massachusetts                        targets                        uas                        unmanned-aerial-system                        us-geological-survey                        usgs                        usgs59b00e05e4b020c...                        whcmsc                        woods-hole-coastal-...",NA,NA

"518","NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR Surface Reflectance, Version 5","This dataset contains gridded daily surface reflectance and brightness temperatures derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors onboard eight NOAA polar orbiting satellites: NOAA-7, -9, -11, -14, -16, -17, -18 and -19. Surface reflectance from AVHRR channels 1 and 2 (at 640 and 860 nm) are a NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR). The dataset spans from 1981 to 10 days before the present, and was processed from the AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) Level 1b dataset. AVHRR GAC observations are packaged into data arrays with latitude and longitude dimensions of 3600 x 7200 covering the globe at 0.05 degree spatial resolution. This dataset is one of the Land Surface CDR Version 5 products produced by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the University of Maryland (UMD). Other Land Surface CDR products include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). Scientific improvements for Version 5 include updating to higher resolution ancillary data and more accurate approaches for BRDF correction, calibration, compositing, and QA. Version 5 also corrects the data for known errors in time, latitude, and longitude variables, as well as improves the global and variable attribute definitions. The dataset is in the netCDF-4 file format following ACDD and CF Conventions. The dataset is accompanied by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code for the NOAA CDR Program.","December 23, 2019","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","advanced very high ...                        avhrr                        brightness temperature                        doc/noaa/nesdis/ncdc                        doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei                        earth science                        geographic region                        global land                        goddard space fligh...                        infrared wavelengths                        land surface                        nasa                        nasa/gsfc                        national centers fo...                        national climatic d...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        national oceanic & ...                        nesdis                        noaa                        noaa climate data r...                        noaa onestop project                        noaa-11                        noaa-14                        noaa-16                        noaa-17                        noaa-18                        noaa-19                        noaa-7                        noaa-9                        reflectance                        spectral/engineering                        surface radiative p...                        u.s. department of ...                        umd                        university of maryland",NA,NA

"536","Megapixel mercury cadmium telluride focal plane arrays for infrared imaging out to 12 microns, Phase I","We propose the fabrication of large format, long wave infrared (LWIR) mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe or MCT) detector arrays where the cutoff wavelength is extended to 12 micron at cryogenic temperatures for use in missions to near earth objects, comets, and the outer planets.  The MCT detector arrays will be a high performance improvement to meet the detector needs for future NASA missions.  The MCT material for these detector arrays will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) substrates to produce high quality semiconductor material with low defect densities. In this Phase I proposed effort EPIR, Inc. (EPIR) will fabricate a prototype focal plane array (FPA) where a 12 micron cutoff LWIR MCT detector array on a CZT substrate will be hybridized to a small format readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for capability demonstration purposes.  EPIR will deliver this prototype FPA to the government for further evaluation.  Should this effort progress to Phase II, then LWIR MCT detector arrays will be fabricated for hybridization to large format 1k x 1k ROICs for implementation into future planetary science space missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"538","IHW COMET HALLEY REDUCED SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS V1.0","NASA's International Halley Watch (IHW) has created a Comet Halley Archive. The collection of data spans the full wavelength range as submitted by scientists to the IHW. The observations belong to one of the following Disciplines: Amateur, Astrometry, Infrared Studies, Large-Scale Phenomena, Meteor Studies, Near-Nucleus Studies, Photometry and Polarimetry, Radio Studies, and Spectroscopy and Spectrophotometry. The data collected by these nine disciplines were augmented by Spacecraft measurements. The data were submitted to IHW, but the evaluation and selection for the Archive has been the primary responsibility of the Discipline Specialist Teams for each network in cooperation with the Lead Center. The Spectroscopy and Spectrophotometry Network collected 2732 files of data which were classified as 'reduced', which means that at least wavelength is calibrated and in some cases flux as well. Some data on non-Halley targets for the spectroscopic observations can be grouped according to 'laboratory' calibration, dark, bias, flatfield, sky, and photometric standards. In the first category, a large number of 'arcs' and 'lamps' were used as follows: HE-NE, TH-AR, NE-AR, CU-AR, CU-NE, Thorium, Tungsten, Quartz, and Rubidium. For the 'sky' observers used the twilight, moonlight, and blank sky.

"539","Active Control of Tailored Laminates","Part of a proposed suite of technologies to enable a fully morphing seamless wing, this effort focuses on tailoring composite materials to enhance structural response and generate out-of-plane deflections using in-plane forces. Composite structures employ embedded fibers in different directions to increase strength. This research seeks to investigate the use of tailored composites in these types of applications.Work to date: An analytical feasibility study completed in 2013 determined that in-plane loading can generate significant out-of-plane displacement, effectively yielding wing twist. Also determined was the degree of structural interaction of stiffeners and how to mitigate the suppression of structural response.Looking ahead: Future work will concentrate on enabling continuous outer mold line structures that can change shape. This revolutionary new approach for aircraft design will improve performance and fuel efficiency in numerous ways, as seamless wings would reduce drag and streamline and simplify an airplane’s maneuverability.Benefits Economical: Increases fuel efficiency by reducing dragRobust: Features a simpler wing design without control surfaces that is easy to maintain and less likely to need repairApplications Commercial aircraftGeneral aviation aircraftMilitary transport aircraft","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","armstrong-flight-re...                        completed",NA,NA
"540","Networked Communications and Speech System for Airspace System Assessments, Phase II","Extensive human-in-the-loop testing of NextGen concepts and technologies is typically required in a controlled lab environment before they can be integrated for evaluation in the field. The experiments tend to require the participation of a large number of subject-matter experts (SMEs) including air traffic controllers (ATC) and (pseudo-)pilots, which makes the experiments costly and the logistics with so many participants make them difficult to plan. These experiments often are designed only to collect data from either ATC or the pilots, but not both; the counterpart is needed only to provide realism in communication between them. The proposed research will develop a Speech-Enabled Simulation Interface Agent (SESIA) to replace the non-essential human subjects in these experiments. SESIA can interact with the SMEs through voice communication, and interface with the simulation platform to perform the intended control. It has the benefit of reduced cost associated with the experiments and increased convenience in their planning, thus allowing the opportunities to schedule additional testing. In cases where a pseudo-pilot would normally represent multiple flights and communicate to the ATC with the same voice for all flights, SESIA will actually increase the realism of the experiments by allow different voices to be synthesized to simulate different pilots.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA
"541","Adaptive Intelligent Ventilation Noise Control, Phase II","To address the NASA need for quiet on-orbit crew quarters (CQ), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Adaptive Intelligent Ventilation Noise Control (AIVNC) system to reduce acoustic noise inside the CQ and work spaces. AIVNC is based on a new multimodal, skin-like active noise controller that will be easy to retrofit and will not interfere with air flow or generate secondary noise. AIVNC cancels ventilation noise by producing high fidelity, broadband counter-acoustic energy by means of very thin, flat multifrequency active patches under the control of an intelligent adapting module (IAM) based on a spontaneous adapting acoustic model.  In Phase I POC demonstrated AIVNC with in-duct streamlined MAPs based on two piezoelectric materials, reproducing high-quality sound at up to 90 dB from 300 to 10000 Hz with very low distortion; a compact driving MAP amplifier; two IAM algorithms predicting ventilation noise one step ahead to cancel it, reducing noise by up to 27 dB rms with real ISS ventilation noise provided by NASA. In Phase II POC will advance/optimize AIVNC components to build a fully functional AIVNC prototype to reduce CQ noise by >30 dB, satisfying NC 40 requirements for NASA crew quarters.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA

It offers advantages in performance, ease of cleanup, compatibility with on-board environmental systems, and ability to recharge during a mission. ADA Technologies has designed a prototype hand-held extinguisher that is being tested at ambient environmental conditions.In this SBIR program ADA Technologies proposes to advance this prototype with a new design for a reduced-momentum nozzle to generate a fine water mist that can be discharged into confined and obstructed spaces to attack hidden fires as well as open fires in manned spacecraft. In Phase I multiple nozzle concepts will be designed, fabricated, and competed to identify the most promising concepts. In addition, we will adapt a vacuum chamber at team member Colorado School of Mines to evaluate the advanced nozzles against fires in an atmosphere of 34% oxygen and 7.6 psia total pressure, representative of the conditions in manned spacecraft. These tests will validate the efficacy of Fine Water Mist at these nonstandard atmospheric conditions. Phase I products will include a comprehensive specification for a beta prototype hand-held FWM extinguisher that incorporates the best advanced reduced momentum nozzle.In Phase II we will carry the beta prototype design forward to testing in microgravity and develop a plan for flight qualification of the hardware. We will work with a partner experienced in the production and qualification of flight test fixtures and experiments.

These devices have primarily been rectangular coaxial transmission lines, although rectangular waveguide and other structures have also been demonstrated.  Intricate devices have been demonstrated with insertion loss 5 to 10 times lower than traditional planar circuits; isolation better than 60dB for lines that share separating walls; multiple levels of densely-packed coaxial circuits; and low-parasitic attachment to active devices and traditional circuit boards.  In this Phase I project, Nuvotronics is proposing to develop high density low-loss millimeter backplane circuits to package and interconnect components of  future NASA millimeter wave (MMW) radars.  The significance of the innovation primarily lies in three areas: reduction of system size, weight and loss in MMW radars.  The PolyStrata technology is a batch manufacturing process, providing economies of scale and cost reduction for higher volumes, in addition to flexibility in design for various frequencies of interest.  Nuvotronics will design and test select Polystrata interconnects at MMW frequencies of interest, with particular attention to performance over temperature and survivability to launch conditions.  The result of the Phase I research will prove the feasibilty of utlizing the Polystrata MMW backplane technology in future NASA missions, and provide the foundation for full scale development, testing, and prototype delivery during the Phase II project.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"553","Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) Data from the Lunar Lake 2000 Campaign","The AIRMISR_LUNAR_LAKE_2000 data were acquired during a flight over Lunar Lake, Nevada on June 11, 2000. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aft For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2).","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC","earth-science                        infrared-wavelengths                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        spectral-engineering                        visible-wavelengths","public",NA

"555","Development of High Contrast Lenslets for Integral Field Spectroscopy","A key goal of NASA’s Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) is to discover Earth-like exoplanets and to determine their spectra for spectral signatures of life. Toward that goal there is on-going development of several competing architectures for how to suppress the starlight and achieve the high contrast necessary to directly image an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone around a nearby star, including coronagraphs, external occulters, and nulling interferometers operating at optical wavelengths.Regardless of the starlight suppression technology chosen, any future planet imaging mission must have a highly capable science instrument able to perform both imaging and spectroscopy in order to detect and characterize the target planets.  The ideal instrument for making these measurements is an integral field spectrograph (IFS), an instrument that obtains a spectrum at every spatial element in the field of view.  The current state of the art for these instruments does not yet achieve the challenging performance requirements needed for imaging of Earth-like exoplanets due to a variety of challenging systematics. In particular, current lenslet designs introduce too high a level of crosstalk between adjacent spectra to operate at very high contrasts.In space, an IFS science camera will be used to investigate the properties of exoplanets while monitoring and diagnosing wavefront errors introduced by the telescope optical assembly.This research will develop a critical technology needed to build a prototype IFS to advance coronagraphy and extreme wavefront sensing and control algorithms in NASA’s High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT).  Once built, this laboratory IFS will be used as a facility class instrument within the HCIT.    The work builds upon awards from the FY12 IRAD program and the Nancy Grace Roman Technology Fellowship program.As part of those programs, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center designed the Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies (PISCES) integral field spectrograph to be integrated into the JPL HCIT.  However, during this the design phase, it became apparent that even though lenslet-based integral field spectrographs exist on the ground, high contrast lenslet arrays are still at a low TRL.   This work will design, model, fabricate, and performance assess a specialized lenslet array in order to meet the requirements of a high contrast imaging mission.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

Multi-gram quantities of pure DWNTs, hydrogen-containing functional derivatives of DWNTs, highly hydrogenated fullerenes have been synthesized and incorporated in polyethylene matrix to form composite materials of exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability and enhanced proton radiation shielding efficiency.    The tensile strength of the low-density polyethylene composites with DWNTs was evaluated to be in excess of 200 MPa, and the Young's modulus exceeds 3500 MPa, while the composite toughness is retained at a very high level of ca. 10 J/cm3. These values compare favorably to the strongest polymer films, including those of aramide polymers. The thermal oxidation degradation point of polyethylene is up-shifted by more than 100 oC at 1 wt. % loading of the DWNT filler. A prominent increase in proton radiation shielding efficiency, reaching 35 % in terms of water equivalence thickness was obtained for composites containing DWNTs and fullerene hydrides. Virtually no degradation in properties was observed upon proton irradiation.In Phase II, the central technological achievement of Phase I effort, the effective lamination of the unique as-produced DWNT films with polyethylene will be further developed for manufacturing practical composite articles for aerospace applications, including advanced components for EVA suits.

"565","In-Flight and Pre-Flight Detection of Pitot Tube Anomalies, Phase I","The health and integrity of aircraft sensors and instruments play a critical role in aviation safety.  However, inaccurate or false readings from these same sensors/instruments can lead to improper decision-making resulting in serious if not fatal consequences. This proposal offers a research and development (R&D) effort to demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced data analysis techniques to identify failures in pitot tubes resulting from blockage, icing, or moisture.  These data analysis techniques will use existing electrical signals of pitot tube sensors that result from measured processes during in-flight conditions and/or induced signals in pre-flight conditions to detect anomalies in the sensor readings.The proposed method for detecting pitot tube anomalies is referred to as the ""noise analysis"" technique.  This technique has been validated and is currently and routinely used by the proposing firm and others for detecting sensing line blockages of pressure transmitters in nuclear power generating stations; a very similar issue to the concern associated with pitot tube blockages.Typically, the output of a sensor that is measuring a process (e.g. air flow) contains two components: a static (DC) component that represents the process parameter, and a dynamic (AC) component.  Through the use of the dynamic component of existing electrical signals, the dynamic response of the sensor can be measured in the frequency domain.  As the sensor becomes blocked or degraded, changes to the dynamic response can be observed.  Specific examples of this are given in the proposal.Another consideration in this proposal is diagnosing pitot tube sensor anomalies in pre-flight conditions.  In pre-flight checks, the pitot tubes reside in mild conditions and will not be measuring a turbulent process.  As such, a technique is proposed to induce this type of noise on the sensor input and analyze the resultant output using the same noise analysis technique.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA
"566","Inside-Out Manufacturing of Composite Structures","Tooling for the manufacture of large structures from composite materials often costs much more than individual parts, rendering the processes unattractive for prototype designs.  A new design for manufacturing philosphy for multifunctional composite structures is suggested that does not require the use of hard tooling to form large complex shapes.  By utilizing a thin rigid and form-able pre-form such as a metal screen or foam core, fiber reinforcement may be tacked into place and vacuum bagged on both sides to perform resin infusion without the need for any tooling.  The process is expected to be scalable and capable of forming large structures including most shapes envisioned for launch vehicles, exploration vehicles, and habitats. The process will also be applicable to architecture and commercial industrial process equipment such as cooling towers and offshore platforms.  The process could reduce the cost of manufacturing composite prototype structures by more than one-half by eliminating the need for hard tooling.Demonstrate the inside-out manufacturing process by manufacturing a complex shaped composite structure with imbedded wiring and fluid handling without the use of a tooling form. Utilize the core as the tool and build parts from the inside-out, placing utilities before composite structure.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA

The resulting material would form an aerodynamically smooth, uniform coating with better cohesion and significantly lower thermal conductivity.  This would allow thinner layers of insulation which, when combined with greater material strain-to-failure, will eliminate the generation of in-flight debris.

"573","Discovering Anomalous Aviation Safety Events Using Scalable Data Mining Algorithms","The worldwide civilian aviation system is one of the most complex dynamical systems created. Most modern commercial aircraft have onboard flight data recorders that record several hundred discrete and continuous parameters at approximately 1Hz for the entire duration of the flight. These data contain information about the flight control systems, actuators, engines, landing gear, avionics, and pilot commands. In this paper, recent advances in the development of a novel knowledge discovery process consisting of a suite of data mining techniques for identifying precursors to aviation safety incidents are discussed. The data mining techniques include scalable multiple-kernel learning for large-scale distributed anomaly detection. A novel multivariate time-series search algorithm is used to search for signatures of discovered anomalies on massive datasets. The process can identify operationally significant events due to environmental, mechanical, and human factors issues in the high-dimensional flight operations quality assurance data. All discovered anomalies are validated by a team of independent domain experts. This novel automated knowledge discovery process is aimed at complementing the state-of-the-art human-generated exceedance-based analysis that fails to discover previously unknown aviation safety incidents. In this paper, the discovery pipeline, the methods used, and some of the significant anomalies detected on real-world commercial aviation data are discussed.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

Existing LIBS instruments are not compact enough for space applications. Major obstructs for miniaturization are from: high voltage Q-switch based pulse laser, inefficient light collection system and bulky high sensitive array-detection. Based on a revolutionary low-voltage Q-switch technology and high efficient laser delivery and light collection scheme, Boston Applied Technologies proposes to develop an ultra-compact high sensitive LIBS instrument for NASA application. The laser featured fast and dual-pulse Q-switch with low switching voltage, ultra reliable fiber-ring cavity design, and high efficient laser-diode pumping. The low switching voltage also brings the advantage of reducing the complexity of the electronic driver design, which is a big chunk in existing electro-optical or acoustic-optic Q-switching lasers. The required ablation energy can be significantly reduced due to high efficiency of the proposed system. The resultant LIBS instrument will be compact, cost-effective and reliable. It will be capable of withstanding operation in space and planetary environmental extremes, which include temperature, pressure, radiation, and impact stresses.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

We will develop non-linear navigation estimation algorithms to fuse the sensor outputs together as well as to integrate the system output with other on-board navigation systems. The state estimate generation using three different techniques will increase the system's robustness through the ability to reject faulty measurements from one component of the system. Phase I of the SBIR will verify feasibility of the HGS design and the navigation algorithms and will culminate in a realistic mission simulation of vehicles using the HGS as part of an integrated GN&C system.

Three Spacecraft Fire Experiment (Saffire) flight units were developed and have flown on three sequential flights of Orbital ATK's Cygnus re-supply vehicle. Saffire-I was launched on OA-6 in March 2016, Saffire-II on OA-5 in October 2016, and Saffire-III on OA-7 in March 2017.  The Saffire-I, II, and III experiments were all operated successfully in June 2016, November 2016, and June 2017, respectively. Three more Saffire experiments, Saffire-IV-VI, are now being developed to continue to investigate material flammability risks that will be faced by the crew on NASA's long duration exploration missions, especially at reduced pressure and higher oxygen concentrations. These experiments will also obtain data on large-scale spacecraft fire detection, monitoring, and post-fire cleanup as well as obtain valuable data to allow spacecraft designers and engineers to predict the development of fire scenarios in exploration vehicles and habitats. The SFS Demo Project is managed by NASA John H. Glenn Research Center (GRC) who also developed the design and fabricated the hardware. Personnel from NASA Johnson Spaceflight Center and the NASA White Sands Test Facility were also instrumental in fabricating and testing the Saffire hardware. The NASA team is augmented by an international topical team assembled by the European Space Agency (ESA). Each member of this team brings expertise and funding from their respective space and research agencies for their activities. The experiment hardware for Saffire-I-VI is approximately 53 cm x 90 cm x 133 cm and consists of a flow duct, containing the sample material to be burned, fans, and flow straightener, and an avionics bay, containing the power management system, control computer, signal conditioning card, and cameras. Saffire-I and III had a single large sample (0.4 m x 0.9 m) made of a composite fabric (75% cotton/25% fiberglass by mass) that has been studied in previous low-gravity experiments although using much smaller samples. This sample burned completely during the tests and yielded information about the fate (flame size and spread rate) of a large-scale fire in low-gravity. Saffire-II had nine samples (5-cm wide x 30-cm long) of various materials that were selected to investigate the low-gravity Maximum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) flammability limits in long-term low gravity. These samples emulate the configuration used in NASA-STD-6001 Test 1, the flammability test conducted in normal gravity to determine if a flame will spread upward over the sample or if it will self-extinguish. A material that self-extinguishes is considered as being safe for use in spacecraft from the standpoint of flammability. To conduct the Saffire experiments, the Saffire hardware is loaded in the Cygnus Pressurized Cargo Module by Orbital ATK and launched from the Wallops Flight Facility. Once at the International Space Station, Saffire remains unpowered on Cygnus while supplies for the ISS are off-loaded by the crew. Once supplies are off-loaded and replaced with trash, Cygnus departs. When the vehicle reaches a safe distance from the ISS, Saffire will be powered on by a team of Orbital ATK and Saffire engineers working from Orbital ATK's Dulles Control Center in Dulles, VA. After conducting system checks, Cygnus will be put into free drift and the experiment initiated. Saffire-I, II, and III ran autonomously for about 2-1/2 hours. With the expanded objectives of Saffire-IV-VI, the experiment will require about 8 hours to be completed. When the experiment is complete, Cygnus continues to orbit the earth while the data is downlinked to various ground stations. When downlink is complete, Cygnus will then begin its reentry into the","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA
"595","Compact High Efficiency GaN-based PPU, Phase I","Busek proposes to develop a low-cost, lightweight Hall Effect Thruster (HET) Power Processing Unit (PPU) at targeted 1kW/kg power density with more than 97% efficiency. The proposed PPU solution adopts advanced GaN power MOSFETs and PCB based planar magnetics technology to enable high switching frequency operation. Reduced headcount of magnetics, semiconductors and associated driver integrated circuits will allow for significant size reduction of all passive components to support ultra-high power density designs. This innovation will further miniaturize HET PPUs from today’s state-of-art by an anticipated 30% in volume and mass, with cost reductions exceeding 50% versus SOA solutions.The unique advantages of the proposed system can be summarized in three parts. First, the system utilizes a novel single-core multi-port circuit topology which integrates all the PPU subsystems through a single stage power conversion using a single multi-winding transformer. This significantly reduces system volume, weight, and cost. Second, the power flow control for each subsystem is fully independent regardless of power stage sharing. Each subsystem has its own phase shift control to regulate the desired output voltage and current. Third, the proposed PPU circuit topology is essentially a soft-switching DC-DC converter which can ensure zero-voltage-switching operation for all the switching devices. The proposal adopts the advanced GaN power MOSFETs and PCB based planar magnetics technology to enable high switching frequency operation, which supports a 30% size reduction of magnetics and other passive components in the high-efficiency and high-power density design.In Phase II Busek will characterize the breadboard PPU with sub-kilowatt Hall thrusters and develop a proto-flight brass-board level unit using GaN devices. At the conclusion of Phase II, Busek will deliver a PPU to NASA for additional characterization testing.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

"604","Instrument Design for the CubeSat Ultraviolet Transient/Imaging Experiment","We are developing a mission concept for a CubeSat-based synoptic imaging survey to explore the ultraviolet sky for several key discoveries in time-domain astrophysics. The IRAD investigation will mature a sensitive, wide-field instrument design optimized to produce new and unique observations of transient astrophysical events (supernova shock breakout, gamma-ray bursts, tidal disruption events, and variable stars and quasars). With this design concept in hand, the CUTIE CubeSat mission will be ready to begin development should it be approved for funding. Our primary objective is the design of a science instrument – in this case, a wide field-of-view ultraviolet camera – with the largest possible aperture for a CubeSat payload. We intend to incorporate new techniques such as 3D printing of lightweight structures, combined with commercial CCDs and Goddard’s unique expertise in the development of high performance compact science instruments in the ultraviolet.CUTIE’s science case is based on several transient phenomena that are best, and in some cases only, observable in the ultraviolet from space. One such example is the early shock breakout from supernovae. This signal, coming in the UV when radiation from the expanding shockwave first escapes from the stellar envelope, directly encodes the radius of the progenitor star – information that is lost at later times and at longer wavelengths.    CUTIE should find one such supernova every day during operation.This innovative transient monitoring strategy relies on a very wide field of view with high efficiency ultraviolet optics. The étendue of this CubeSat instrument is 30 times greater than that of GALEX, the last UV Explorer mission, yet can be done with a small, low-cost design. This permits roughly 10% of the sky to be patrolled repeatedly for time-variable sources at high sensitivity. The novelty of such capability with such modest project scope will make for a compelling CubeSat proposal.We intend to mature the science payload through four parallel paths, all equally important. One thrust will be to produce a capable optical design, crucial to being able to realize the science promise of the mission. A second will be to develop a telescope structure suitable for a CubeSat in a lightweight format. The third consists of the design of a low-power, low-noise CCD controller to provide high sensitivity imaging. The fourth task is to develop a detailed science simulation framework that can be used to predict the performance of CUTIE for all its science cases as a function of the instrument design and operational plan.The CUTIE concept is for a 6U payload, which can accommodate a telescope of roughly 9cm diameter. With baffling, it will consume around 2U, while the CCD chip and readout electronics will fit in the 1U behind the optics. An additional 3U for the spacecraft components, particularly for power and attitude determination/control, are fully used. All the spacecraft components and the 6U structure are commercially available, CubeSat-specific designs. A mechanical prototype of such a structure with a representative telescope has been produced by the company ISIS (figure at above right). It features a skeletonized structure with multiple mounting points, space for standard CubeSat electronics, and full bay space for larger systems such as an attitude determination/control system.These four design elements enabled the CUTIE CubeSat mission concept to be proposed in March 2015 to ROSES/APRA, for a single flight design and build (total cost a few $M). In the future, multiple copies of CUTIE can be funded as an Explorer Mission of Opportunity, with the swarm of CubeSats enabling improved sky coverage, sensitivity, and/or cadence of the time-domain monitoring of transient sources.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

MotionPort will use the Compact Telescoping Surface Array (CTSA) concept, developed by NASA Langley, for the example model. Simulations will be run to demonstrate the capability of simulating dust accumulation on the deployed solar array. Two active dust removal concepts will be simulated:  1) High velocity winds will be applied to determine required wind velocities and orientation to successfully remove dust, and 2) A tilt and shake mechanism will be added to the solar array model to mechanically tilt and add vibration to the structure to ‘shake’ off the dust.The CTSA will be modeled in the RecurDyn multibody dynamics software, considering the deployed configuration and a sampling of operating configurations. Simulations of dust particles will demonstrate the rate of dust accumulation on the surface of a solar array. An example of this type of simulation is shown in the image. Dust particles were simulated blowing past a rectangular plate with a reduced gravity. Simulations will be used to determine the effect of tilt angle of the solar array on dust abatement.These simulations will be built upon to demonstrate the ability to simulate removal of dust using a high velocity wind. The results will be compared to available data. Co-simulation with RecurDyn and the Particleworks SPH CFD software will simulate the use of a tilt and shake mechanism to remove dust. Simulations will test the efficiency of dust removal as a function of magnitude and frequency of the shaking mechanism.A custom application will be developed to automate repetitive steps such as: simplification of the mechanical model, parameter management, and file management. The simulations results, lessons learned, and user information will be documented.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"608","A Parallel Boltzmann Simulation for Multi-grid Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion","Inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) is a means of confining a non-neutral, non-Maxwellian plasma with an electric field, with the goal of creating fusion energy. The primary application is for the generation of power for high-powered electric propulsion systems on spacecraft. The most basic IEC device consists of two spherical concentric grids, with the inner cathode grid maintained at a lower potential than the outer anode grid to create an electrostatic potential well. To generate fusion events, ions are released from points inside the anode and accelerate towards the core. Counter-streaming ions may collide in the core, producing fusion events. Unfortunately, the energy losses associated with ion thermalization in this two-grid configuration have rendered net power generation impossible.Recent developments in the field of IEC consist of additional concentric grids to focus the ion beams to limit scattering and thermalization. The result is the multi-grid IEC. Added beam-focusing grids have been shown experimentally to increase ion residence times as well as bunch the ions into resonant packets. Over my past year of research, I have created a numerical model of ion transport in the multi-grid IEC system using a numerical approximation to the Boltzmann equation tailored to our system. Ion accelerations in the model are due to the electric field from the charged grids as well as from the space charge of the ions themselves. As the IEC chamber is nearly spherically symmetric, it is only necessary to model one ion packet, with the assumption that counter- and cross-streaming ion packets are identical. The model has also addressed ion-ion coulomb collisions between these packets modeled through the Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator. The code has been parallelized for GPU processing to mitigate long simulation run-times.Methods to further increase ion confinement times in the multi-grid IEC designs have been proposed, and must be incorporated into my model so that future IEC experimental research can be effectively directed. These methods include the extension of a filament to the device core to maintain a beam-neutralizing electron population, the introduction of permanent magnets to the innermost sphere to further confine these electrons, and the implementation of voltage-oscillating grid potentials to accelerate ions and provide greater control over ion packet formation. To direct this future research, a numerical model is needed to simulate plasma dynamics and optimize system parameters. Electrons will be modeled as an equilibrium solution at each time step, so that the simulation does not have to be resolved to the electron time-scale, and a magnetic force term will be added to the numerical transport equations.The primary purpose of an IEC fusor is the enablement of high powered electric propulsion (EP) thrusters currently in development. As IEC requires vacuum operation, and is easily scaled down without loss of specific power or efficiency, deployment on spacecraft is ideal. The IEC-EP coupling is necessary to reduce launch payload masses and make proposed transits (such as to Mars) more feasible and economical than current specific impulse limited chemical rockets. This motivation is in alignment with the Space Power and Energy Storage Roadmap which delineates the need for a high-power, low-specific mass power generator to enable future desired missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        university-of-maryland",NA,NA

The connections among greenhouse-gas emissions scenarios, global warming, and frequenciesof hurricanes or tropical cyclones are among the least understood in climate sciencebut among the most fiercely debated in the context of adaptation decisions or mitigation policies.Here we show that a knowledge discovery strategy, which leverages observations and climatemodel simulations, offers the promise of developing credible projections of tropical cyclones basedon sea surface temperatures (SST) in a warming environment. While this study motivates thedevelopment of new methodologies in statistics and data mining, the ability to solve challengingclimate science problems with innovative combinations of traditional and state-of-the-art methodsis demonstrated. Here we develop new insights, albeit in a proof-of-concept sense, on the relationshipbetween sea surface temperatures and hurricane frequencies, and generate the most likelyprojections with uncertainty bounds for storm counts in the 21st-century warming environmentbased in turn on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on EmissionsScenarios. Our preliminary insights point to the benefits that can be achieved for climate scienceand impacts analysis, as well as adaptation and mitigation policies, by a solution strategy thatremains tailored to the climate domain and complements physics-based climate model simulationswith a combination of existing and new computational and data science approaches.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA
"611","A Hard Look at Accretion and Ejection from Neutron Stars","This proposal describes a series of projects that will improve our understanding of how neutron stars accrete and eject matter, as well as our understanding of neutron stars themselves. These questions are central to the NASA Astrophysics Theme, ""The Physics of the Cosmos"". Simultaneous X-ray and radio studies of black holes have established a clear correlation, but it is less clear if neutron stars obey the same coupling. With the flexibility of Swift, the sensitivity of NuSTAR, and the new sensitivity of the upgraded VLA, the time is ideal to understand how neutron stars accrete and launch jets. This is particularly important in an era of Galactic surveys that identify the nature of sources based on their radio/X-ray flux ratio; the behavior of neutron stars must be understood to make secure identifications.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        regents-of-the-univ...",NA,NA

"618","Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_HIRS3_NOAA17_OMA) at GES DISC","The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","altitude                        atmosphere                        earth-science                        land-surface                        land-use-land-cover                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        topography","public",NA

Phase I successfully demonstrated the use of HG blankets for sound transmission suppression and the applicability of the technology to aircraft interior noise control perpetuating a license agreement with a major U.S. Fortune 100 company to aggressively and expeditiously pursue product commercialization.  The highest performing HG blanket resulted in ~5 dB reduction in radiated power from an aircraft test panel.  Reductions are broadband with an effective frequency range from approximately 100 to 1000 Hz resulting in decreased vibration and radiated acoustic levels across this range.  The small 6-10% weight has acoustic benefits far greater than standard mass law effects.  In Phase II attachment, temperature, and installation effects will be studied.  Additionally, analytical design tools will be developed to automate the design process for practicing engineers making it possible to work from basic concepts and application requirements/specifications to achieve a final product which can be readily manufactured.  Together the proven design concepts of Phase I and those proposed in Phase II represent the future in aircraft insulation in terms of acoustic performance, cost, weight, airframe integration, and passenger safety.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"625","TES/Aura L2 Nitrous Oxide Nadir Special Observation V007","TL2N2ONS_7 is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)/Aura Level 2 Nitrous Oxide Nadir Special Observation Version 7 data product. It consists of information for one molecular species for an entire Global Survey or Special Observation. TES Level 2 data contain retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the observation targets and the estimated errors. The geolocation, quality and other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) are also provided. L2 modeled spectra are evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compares observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updates the atmospheric parameters. L2 standard product files include information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. A global survey consists of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits. Nadir and limb observations are in separate L2 files, and a single ancillary file is composed of data that are common to both nadir and limb files. A Nadir sequence within the TES Global Survey is a fixed number of observations within an orbit for a Global Survey. Prior to April 24, 2005, it consisted of two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. After April 24, 2005, Global Survey data consisted of three low resolution scans. The Nadir standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations currently only use a single set of filter mix. A Limb sequence within the TES Global Survey is three high-resolution scans over the same limb locations. The Limb standard product will consist of four files, where each file will be composed of the Global Survey Limb observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Limb observations use a repeating sequence of filter wheel positions. Special Observations can only be scheduled during the 9 or 10 orbit gaps in the Global Surveys, and are conducted in any of three basic modes: stare, transect, step-and-stare. The mode used depends on the science requirement. See http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/instrument/special observations/ for details. A Global Survey consists of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 4,608 retrievals are performed (1,152 nadir retrievals and 1,152 retrievals in time ordered sequence for each limb observation). Each observation is the input for retrievals of species Volume Mixing Ratios (VMR), temperature profiles, surface temperature and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density and other diagnostic quantities. Each TES Level 2 standard product reports information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object is bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product can have a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging is employed. Also, missing or bad retrievals are not reported. Each limb observation Limb 1, Limb 2 and Limb 3, are processed independently. Thus, each limb standard product consists of three sets where each set consist of 1,152 observations. For TES, the swath object represents one of these sets. Thus, each limb standard product consists of three swath objects, one for each observation, Limb 1, Limb 2, and Limb 3. The organization of data within the Swath object is based on a superset of the UARS pressure levels used to report concentrations of trace atmospheric gases. The reporting grid is the same pressure grid used for modeling. There are 67 reporting levels from 1211.53 hPa, which allows for very high surface pres","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC","air-quality                        atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        earth-science","public",NA

"627","Through-Thickness Health Monitoring of Thermal Protection Systems, Phase I","This program addresses the need to monitor surface recession, temperature, and through-thickness properties of thermal protection system (TPS) materials.  These TPS materials have unique properties for shedding the heat generated under reentry conditions to protect the integrity of the spacecraft.  However, ever-increasing mission demands require improved performance and a better understanding for modern heat shield structures.  This can be accomplished with a noninvasive, nondestructive method that uses projected sensing fields through the thickness of the TPS material.  Novel eddy current methods are proposed that incorporate innovative sensor array constructs, physics-based models, and multivariate inverse methods to nondestructively assess carbon-based TPS materials such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA).  The sensors can be mounted behind the TPS material or embedded within the TPS with sensing magnetic fields that are projected through the material.JENTEK's physics-based methods for diagnostics of layered media using MWM-Array technologies have been demonstrated as a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for flexible and rigid ablative TPS materials for condition, orientation, and thickness assessment.  These methods are commonly used for NDE, such as coating characterization, and have been extended to surface mounted sensing applications such as torque, fatigue, and heat treatment condition monitoring.  This proposed Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of these methods in an embedded sensor configuration for representative material layer configurations and a heating transient as well as investigate the adaptations required for full-scale testing and operation.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle leading edge to detect damage of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a novel method for health monitoring of TPS materials.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

The computational framework will be comprehensive to include instabilities ranging from turbulent pressure fluctuations due to vortex shedding in bends and elbows of the piping system to large scale fluctuations due to collapse of vapor cavities in flow control elements such as venturis.  Furthermore, the development in this proposal will include prediction of system response such as amplification and attenuation of dominant instability modes from coupling between components. In Phase II of the proposal development will focus on fluid structure interaction, structural vibrations and resonance.  This will greatly enhance the current CFD technology utilized for performance analyses of valve and feed based systems and improve the ability to exert flow control, gauge system response, regulate pressure and suppress instabilities in rocket propulsion test facilities.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        stennis-space-center",NA,NA

In FY2015 we will continue to characterize the thermal properties of porous silicon and use this data to build a low thermal conductivity support structure for a prototype bolometer detector. This will provide a basis for higher performance and higher fill-factor detector arrays for future NASA missions In addition, we will explore the optical properties of the etched porous silicon layers to construct a multilayer infrared filter which has general applicability for Mid-IR and Terahertz instruments.    In FY2015, we will move forward with proof-of-concept devices that will show the feasibility of exploiting porous silicon for its thermal and optical properties. Porous Silicon is formed by an electrochemical etch of a silicon surface in a solution of a hydrofluoric-acid-based electrolyte.    The etching process turns the crystalline solid into one with a network of nano-capillaries creating nanopores of varying surface to volume ratio depending on the selected conditions. The porosity of the silicon may be varied over a wide range.We have two cross cutting goals for the coming year.   First, we will build a simple support structure for a single pixel bolometer prototype that incorporates porous silicon with high critical temperature pixels. The electrical routing between the pixel and the support will be done with high resolution gold patterning.  We will  also continue to explore the multilayers of porous silicon and silicon structures.  We will begin rigorous characterization to study how well the thickness and refractive index can be controlled.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

The performance of these applications would benefit significantly from materials designed for high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions. NASA's Venus mission has some of the most stringent requirements with an operating temperature of 486C. Power systems must operate efficiently at these temperatures to eliminate the need for onboard cooling systems. The removal of these cooling systems will save space, reduce weight, and improve reliability. Currently, BaTiO3-based X7R capacitors are re-rated for use above 125C, and are rendered inoperable at temperatures approaching 300C. NPO-type dielectrics tend to operate at somewhat higher temperatures, but have low dielectric constants and become unreliable above 400C. TRS Technologies is pleased to respond to NASA's need for high temperature capacitors with this Phase I SBIR proposal. In this SBIR program, TRS Technologies and its subsidiary, Centre Capacitor, will develop a new family of high temperature capacitors based on high Curie temperature ferroelectrics that operate at temperatures far beyond conventional dielectric formulations. These new higher temperature (~490C) materials will be suited for the advanced power electronics required for Venus exploration.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"643","Miniature, Conformal, and Spectrally Agile Ultra Wideband Phased Array Antenna for Communication and Sensing","Communications, sensing, imaging and navigation functions are integral to NASA’s space missions. Central to these functions are Radio Frequency (RF) front ends that are frequency agile, wideband, reconfigurable, very small in size and weight, and of low power (SWAP). Such RF front ends can be used for deep space missions enabling remote reconfiguration and for communications using small satellites such as CubeSats. This project is concerned with the development of small-size, and low power wideband phased arrays (with digital beam forming) for satellites and multi-mission deep space exploration. For the first time, the proposed simple/low-cost phased array will enable on-demand sensing at multiple bands, coupled with adjustable high resolution imaging across various bands. Central to the proposed small wideband array is its unprecedented 20:1 bandwidth. This proposal will build upon this game-changing technology to develop (a) feed networks of equal bandwidth to the phased array, operating at millimeter wavelengths and sub-terahertz frequencies, and (b) low cost beam former technology utilizing on-site encoding to separate signals prior to digitization. This novel on-site coding will allow for a single analog to digital (ADC) or digital to analog converter (DAC) to serve as many as 64 antenna array elements. As such, major reductions in size, complexity and power requirements are envisioned. This is because beam forming and spectral reconfiguration functions are transferred to the processor, implying major agility in the phased arrays functionality for multi-mission operations.Despite their advantages, current phased array systems with associated feed and beam forming electronics have excessive costs, weight, and power consumption, limiting their use for NASA missions. However, recently, a new class of ultra-thin and ultra-wideband arrays were introduced based on the adaptation of emulated anisotropy. By taking advantage of this in-plane anisotropy, for the first time, in-situ ultra wideband apertures and phased arrays were realized. To our knowledge, this technology is the first to overcome the traditional narrowband conundrum for conformal arrays. It is based on the concatenation of novel interweaved antenna elements to realize wideband metamaterials, a concept developed recently under a MURI project at Ohio State that ended in 2009-2010.Currently, no practical phased arrays are available to achieve beam forming and good impedance matching over 20:1 bandwidths. As part of this 4-year research plan, we will develop phased arrays operating from 5 to 100GHz with continuous operation across the entire bandwidth and with minimal reconfiguration, if need be. Among the envisioned features (not mentioned above), the proposed ultra wideband phased array will 1) Provide high gain and large data rates through digital beam forming across a remarkable 20:1 bandwidth, 2) Lead to increased lifetime by replacing bulky satellite dishes with movable parts, 3) Enable spectral agility for imaging and sensing, allowing for trade off between penetration and resolution, 4) Combine sensing and communication functions in a single aperture, and (8) Enable mission adaptability based on changing requirements, and while the satellite or payload is in space. The year to year research plan is as follows: Year 1: The array feed structure and architecture will be resolved, Year 2: Transceiver design will be adapted to reflect commercially available components, Year 3: Aperture and beam former integration with component testing at NASA Glenn (possibly working with Dr. Felix Miranda and Dr. Richard Reinhart), and Year 4: Integrated transceiver testing at NASA Glenn across 5-100GHz, and incorporating NASA’s SCaN Testbed and Software Defined Radio (SDR) modules.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        ohio-state-university",NA,NA
"644","Hybrid Heat Pipes for High Heat Flux Applications, Phase II","The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45°.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA
"645","Flight Lossless Data Compression Electronics, Phase II","AbstractThere is a valid scientific data paradigm where no loss of data can be tolerated.  However, transmission of raw data requires unacceptable bandwidth and storage resources such that the net data received is uncomfortably low.  Lossless data compression can be used to preserve all data with no information loss and also help meet bandwidth and storage constraints.  The current Universal Source Encoder of Space (USES) has been meeting many lossless compression needs for a decade.  However, USES is not able to successfully address higher speed instruments, beyond 20 MSamples/sec, or function at quantization levels higher than 15 bits.  The proposed work provides a new solution and presents a lossless data solution that should be valid for at least a decade or more.A radiation tolerant high performance (100M Samples/second) 32-bit lossless custom processor will be delivered in the proposed work which meets the CCSDS 121-0-B 1 recommendation.  The processor will be implemented in a radiation tolerant 0.25 micron CMOS process which realizes a proven algorithm developed at GSFC and implemented in a 15-bit version 10 years ago.  The new compressor is 5 times faster and has twice the input quantization range, suitable for modern spacecraft requirements.

Many vibration signature analysistechniques use a key phasor signal to identify and detect criticalvibration characteristics and fault signatures.  However, in manyoperational environments (e.g., SSME HPOTP), the tachometer measurementis not available usually due to its intrusive installation requirementor safety consideration.  For this situation, many powerful diagnosticanalyses cannot be performed.  With our system, we over come thisproblem by utilizing a novel signal analysis technique called Pseudo KeyPhasor (PKP) to reconstruct an equivalent 1/Rev PKP signal directly froma non-intrusive vibration measurement.  The resulting PKP signal enablesthe use of effective signature analysis to enhance diagnosticcapabilities.  The applicable innovation is attributed to to effectivelyachieve non-intrusive health monitoring and diagnosis without intrusivetachometer installation.

"647","Space Suit Glove Pressure Garment Metacarpal Joint and Robotic Hand Analysis, Phase I","Spacesuit glove pressure garments have been a design challenge for NASA since the inception of spacesuits. The human hand demands a complex range of motions, a close fit, an ease of movement, and a lack of bulk that is at odds with the engineering and durability requirements of an inflated safety garment.  While precision motions of the fingers are relatively well met by NASA's current I.L.C./Phase VI gloves, the torque required for more gross power grips such as translating along bars or grasping tools is significant.  This torque comes not from the individual fingers or phalange-phalange joints, but at the joint between the fingers and the palm, or the metacarpal-phalangeal joint.    In addition, this motion is difficult to precisely measure.  The human hand is capable of omni-directional multifaceted movements that are challenging to mimic robotically.  In addition, the presence of a human wearer makes the measurement impossible to repeat accurately, but it is required to adequately reproduce the movements of the glove.    FFD in collaboration with The Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) propose to develop a glove pattering specific to the bending of the metacarpal-phalangeal joint, and a robotic instrument suitable to measure this torque.  This will lead to even more functional glove pressure garments, and to a more refined way of measuring them.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA
"648","Brine Dewatering Using Ultrasonic Nebulization, Phase II","Recovery of water from brine is critically important for future manned space exploration.  Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for such extended missions.  Water reclamation processes typically recover 90-95% of the water present in wastewater formed by combining urine, hygiene water, and humidity condensate with the remaining concentrated in brine.  This concentrated brine contains a significant amount of water, potentially a very valuable resource.  The proposed prototype development will recover virtually all of the remaining water using an ultrasonic brine dewatering system (UBDS).  In the UBDS process, extremely small nebulized droplets of the brine are created ultrasonically at the brine-air interface.  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their high relative surface area. This is particularly important when drying brines that contain thermally labile materials, which require relatively low temperature drying.  The UBDS prototype has no nozzles to become plugged, requires little power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut attention and is compatible with continuous, closed cycle operation that can be made gravity independent.  The innovative Phase 2 prototype will fulfill the unmet need to significantly improve water loop closure during extended manned missions.  The Phase 2 project will provide an automated UBDS prototype that will be delivered to NASA for further testing.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

In response, CTD is developing novel matrix materials based on toughened epoxy and benzoxazines to meet these goals and exceed the performance of current state of the art materials. The end goal of the Phase II program is to advance the material systems suitable for out-of-autoclave fabrication of very large cryotank (10 meter diameter) structures from TRL 3 to TRL 4.

This paper presents our approach to accomplish a comprehensive test environment equipped with fault injection and data collection capabilities. Efforts also include development of multiple models for EMA operations, both in nominal and fault conditions that can be used along with measurement data to generate effective diagnostic and prognostic estimates. A detailed description has been provided about how various failure modes are inserted in the test environment and corresponding data is collected to verify the physics based models under these failure modes that have been developed in parallel. A design of experiment study has been included to outline the details of experimental data collection.

"658","TES/Aura L2 Atmospheric Temperatures Nadir Special Observation V008","TL2TNS_8 is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)/Aura Level 2 Atmospheric Temperatures Limb Version 8 data product. TES Level 2 data contain retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the observation targets and the estimated errors. The geolocation, quality, and other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) are also provided. L2 modeled spectra are evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compares observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updates the atmospheric parameters. L2 standard product files include information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. A global survey consists of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits.A nadir sequence within the TES Global Survey is a fixed number of observations within an orbit for a Global Survey. Prior to April 24, 2005, it consisted of two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. After April 24, 2005, Global Survey data consisted of three low resolution scans. The Nadir standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations currently only use a single set of filter mix. A Global Survey consists of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 3,200 retrievals are performed. Each observation is the input for retrievals of species Volume Mixing Ratios (VMR), temperature profiles, surface temperature and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density and other diagnostic quantities. Each TES Level 2 standard product reports information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object is bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product can have a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging is employed. Also, missing or bad retrievals are not reported.The organization of data within the Swath object is based on a superset of the UARS pressure levels used to report concentrations of trace atmospheric gases. The reporting grid is the same pressure grid used for modeling. There are 67 reporting levels from 1211.53 hPa, which allows for very high surface pressure conditions, to 0.1 hPa, about 65 km. In addition, the products will report values directly at the surface when possible or at the observed cloud top level. Thus, in the Standard Product files each observation can potentially contain estimates for the concentration of a particular molecule at 67 different pressure levels within the atmosphere. However, for most retrieved profiles, the highest pressure levels are not observed due to a surface at lower pressure or cloud obscuration. For pressure levels corresponding to altitudes below the cloud top or surface, where measurements were not possible, a fill value will be applied.To minimize the duplication of information between the individual species standard products, data fields common to each species (such as spacecraft coordinates, emissivity, and other data fields) have been collected into a separate standard product, termed the TES L2 Ancillary Data product (ESDT short name: TL2ANC). Users of this product should also obtain the Ancillary Data product.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-tempera...                        earth-science","public",NA
"659","Advanced Development of a Multi-Angle Stratospheric Aerosol Radiometer (MASTAR)","The contribution of atmospheric aerosols to the Earth’s energy budget is an important, yet relatively uncertain, component of the Earth system. Stratospheric aerosols represent a less well-studied, but nevertheless significant, element of this contribution through their impact on direct radiative forcing of the climate system. Comprehensive measurements of aerosol extinction vertical profiles with dense spatial sampling are needed to better constrain climate model simulations of aerosol extinction, composition, and particle size, in order to compute climate impacts. The most effective source of stratospheric aerosol extinction data comes from satellite limb scattering measurements, which provide greater sensitivity than space-based lidar and much better spatial sampling than occultation measurements. The Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP), currently flying on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, has been providing daily aerosol extinction profile data from limb scattering measurements since April 2012. While the S-NPP OMPS LP instrument was designed for a 7-year operating lifetime, the next OMPS LP instrument is not scheduled to fly until 2022. This raises the possibility of a data gap in this crucial measurement.We have developed a prototype instrument, called Global Aerosol Monitoring System (GAMS), to supplement the OMPS LP measurements. Our design uses multiple viewing directions to improve spatial sampling and provide more balanced measurement sensitivity throughout the orbit compared to OMPS LP. Wavelength selection in this design is limited to simple filters (675 nm for aerosol science, 350 nm for altitude registration) to enable a compact instrument suitable for Cubesat deployment. This prototype instrument has been developed with NASA GSFC internal funding, and currently meets TRL 2 criteria.This proposal to the Instrument/Measurement Concept Demonstration subelement of the Instrument Incubator Program (IIP-ICD) describes our plans to improve the GAMS design to produce a more scientifically capable and flight-ready instrument (Multi-Angle STratospheric Radiometer, MASTAR). The MASTAR concept was formally submitted to the 2017 Decadal Survey for Earth Science second request for information in May 2016. Adding a second channel at 1020 nm for science measurements will improve aerosol detection capabilities at low altitudes, help determine aerosol particle size properties, and increase continuity with heritage data sets. Optical design studies will be performed to optimize the performance of MASTAR and quantify stray light behavior. We will also assess the potential benefits of incorporating onboard data processing capabilities to satisfy the science objectives. The goal of this effort is to have a laboratory tested MASTAR instrument at TRL 4 by the end of the IIP award period.

"660","Collaborative Object Framework for Adaptive System Optimization, Phase I","TeamVision proposes that we research the feasibility of incorporating an adaptive object based optimization system into an existing multi-user object oriented application integration framework.  Successful implementation of such a system would save NASA and industry billions of dollars annually by reducing significantly the false starts, redundant effort, long lead times and globally non-optimal solutions characteristic of the early decision process of complex systems.  Fortunately, recent breakthroughs in software engineering have demonstrating a practical and proven strategy to this seemingly intractable problem.  The wide spread adoption of Object Oriented languages like C++ in the last ten years has created a revolution in modern software development.  This move away from serial and procedurally based languages to Object Oriented languages has allowed teams of software programmers to collaborate on large and complex software development projects unthinkable under the old language paradigms.  TeamVision is the first company, through a previous NASA-SBIR?s and private funding, to develop and commercialize a software solution that utilizes this approach in the early decision process.  The proposed innovation builds on this successful track record and would significantly expand the field of optimization into new areas.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA

"665","SPURS-2 research vessel CTD profile data for E. Tropical Pacific R/V Revelle cruises","The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is a NASA-funded oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project is comprised of two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) casts were undertaken at stations on each of the two R/V Revelle cruises during SPURS-2. These shipboard lowered CTD probes provide continuous conductivity, salinity, and temperature vertical profile observations at fixed sampling locations. There were a total of 50 and 14 CTD casts made during the first and second R/V Revelle cruises respectively, and the data files available here are for continuous CTD profile data for each of the individual casts deployed.  All CTD data were calibrated using shipboard salinometers using IAPSO standard seawater.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/JPL/PODAAC","earth-science                        ocean-temperature                        oceans                        salinity-density","public",NA

This aided in keeping the aircraft in the plane of a series of RHI scans done by CSU-CHILL. The single polarization CSU-Pawnee radar maintained volume coverage of the echo system while the radial flight legs were in progress.

"669","BxCyNz Nanotube Development and Characterization","Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibit great promise for primary structure as well as thermal and radiation protection for future space exploration missions. They are structurally similar to Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and share extraordinary mechanical properties, but differ in chemical, optical, and electrical properties. Hybrid nanotubes constructed of B, C, and N elements are expected to form a new class of NTs with tunable properties between those of CNTs and BNNTs with increased applications.BNNTs are produced by a new, high temperature pressurized vapor/condensation (PVC) technique without catalysts, using only boron and nitrogen as reactants. BNNTs are electrical insulators with a reported bandgap of about 6.0eV regardless of the chirality. This project adapts the PVC synthesis method to generate and investigate nanotubes consisting of boron, carbon and nitrogen with a controlled composition ratio. It is envisioned that BxCyNz nanotubes with the same excellent properties will be produced (radiation resistance and high aspect ratio, crystallinity and service temperature) but with different electronic and optical properties as a function of B, C, and N composition. With the incorporation of carbon, a tailored bandgap is possible from insulating/semiconducting (6.0eV) to metallic (0eV). Systematic modifications to the current apparatus will be applied to introduce carbon into the reaction zone where B and N precursors combine. In the new method, carbon can be added to the boron vapor through a number of methods. Various density ratios can be achieved with various buffer gases and the presence of oxygen may be useful in scavenging byproducts of the synthesis process. Carbon can be added to the boron vapor plume by modifying the target. Modeling will be used to modify the reaction chamber and parameters to produce optimized BCN nanotubes. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can provide morphology assessment and the composition analysis by using electron diffraction, X-ray mapping, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and energy filtered TEM (EFTEM). EELS can provide a quantitative analysis of the composition. Photoluminescence spectroscopy can be employed to study the band gap of selected BxCyNz tubes in collaboration with the ONERA group. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and TGA-Mass spectroscopy analysis can be correlated with the composition, defect, purity, and quality of the BxCyNz nanotube product.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA
"670","Self-Calibrating Greenhouse Gas Balloon-Borne Sensor, Phase I","Over the past decade, the importance of understanding the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has been recognized.  In particular, airborne measurements of CO2 profiles throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere have provided a great deal of useful information, but the instrumentation used has been restricted to airplane or large stratospheric-type balloon gondola platforms due to the size, weight and power requirements of these instruments.  While a  more widespread measurement campaign using smaller, less expensive balloon sondes could provide very important data, such an approach has been limited by the lack of suitable instrumentation.In this SBIR program, Southwest Sciences proposes to developed a lightweight, inexpensive greenhouse gas sensor suitable for balloon sonde measurements, yet exhibiting specifications that approach those of the much larger and expensive research instruments used on current airborne platforms.  Using a novel ratiometric measurement technique, this sensor will provide dry air mixing ratios of CO2 without the need for concurrent measurements of temperature, pressure or moisture.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

Data collection for this product is complete.The Monthly Gridded Radiative Fluxes and Clouds (FSW) product contains regional averages of instantaneous footprint computed fluxes [Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA), surface, and in-atmosphere (profile)], associated TOA observed fluxes, and cloud parameters only for the hours of satellite overpass. The FSW product contains a month of space and time averaged CERES data for a single scanner instrument. All instantaneous fluxes from the CERES Clouds and Radiative Swath (CRS) product for a month are sorted by 1-degree spatial regions and by the Universal Time (UT) hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-hour bin is determined and recorded on the FSW along with other flux statistics and scene information. The mean adjusted fluxes at the four atmospheric levels defined by CRS are also included for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes. In addition, four cloud height categories are defined by dividing the atmosphere into four intervals with boundaries at the surface, 700-, 500-, 300-hPa, and the TOA. The cloud layers from CRS are put into one of the cloud height categories and averaged over the region. The cloud properties are also column averaged and included on the FSW.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).

There is a growing desire to enable SmallSats to perform ""Long Baseline"" and ""Spatially Diverse"" observation, measurement and collection missions.  Traditionally, these types of missions would be performed using formation flying or using large, costly satellites equipped with complex deployable structures.  For many sensing modalities, fundamental physics demands large apertures or long baselines to achieve the high resolution, sensitivity, and throughput required for these missions.  Reliance upon fixed and deployable aperture/mast technologies prevents small satellites from matching traditional large satellite platforms in terms of performance. The proposed ""MakerSat Demonstration Mission"" effort will develop a third alternative that will enable small satellite platforms to perform his class of missions:  ""Constructable"" technologies, that use in-space manufacturing technologies to enable SmallSats to ""grow"" significantly larger structures.  A SmallSat that, once on orbit, can increase its size from one to two orders of magnitude provides a transformative option to formation flying or deployable structures.  ""MakerSat"" is a low-cost system intended to validate the Constructable SmallSat platform and enable nanosat-class systems to perform missions such as single-pass interferometric SAR, long-baseline radio astronomy, and infrared astronomy.uring the Phase I effort, TUI will develop the Requirements, ConOps and Architecture for the demonstration mission.

"677","Plasma Fairings for Quieting Aircraft Landing Gear Noise, Phase I","A major component of airframe noise for commercial transport aircraft is the deployed landing gear.  The noise from the gear originates due to complex, unsteady bluff body flow separation from gear components and the subsequent multiple interactions of unsteady wakes with downstream undercarriage elements.  The object of this SBIR effort is to develop and advance a novel 'plasma fairing' technology for quieting landing gear noise.  The concept deals with the use of single dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators to reduce noise associated with bluff body separation around the gear.  SDBD plasma actuators will be employed either in the form of spanwise-orientated actuators or plasma streamwise vortex generators (PSVGs) to suppress surface pressure fluctuations, and consequently flow-induced noise, on a representative landing gear model.  Our Phase I effort will involve a combination of numerical and experimental studies to be conducted at Innovative Technology Applications Company, LLC and the University of Notre Dame, respectively, in order to advance the design and optimization of 'plasma fairings' from a simple geometry (tandem circular cylinder) to a more complex/realistic landing gear geometry (e.g., the Gulfstream G550 nose gear).  A combination of DES numerical simulations and wind tunnel experiments is expected to provide a clear demonstration of the plasma fairing performance for noise reduction, while providing a clear path forward for Phase II.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

"685","Autonomous Assessment of Airspace Operations, Phase I","NASA’s 2018 SBIR solicitation topic A3.02 requests “Autonomous systems to produce any of the following system capabilities: Prognostics, data mining, and data discovery to identify opportunities for improvement in airspace operations.” Identifying opportunities for improvement is a critical ongoing need in the air traffic management domain, for which achieving high levels of performance is a daily concern. Its importance will continue as traffic volumes grow and new vehicle classes are introduced. In particular, as new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations become more prevalent, methodologies to quantify performance of both human-centered and autonomous operations will be required. The objective of this work is to discover opportunities for improvement in operations of the National Airspace System (NAS), using methods that advance the state of the art and that can be applied to both current and future operations. To that end, Mosaic ATM proposes to develop a tool that will characterize and classify the efficiency of airspace operations, with a focus on airport metroplex operations. We propose to leverage the latest in machine learning techniques to create supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, which will be trained and validated using large sets of archived flight and weather data. These models will be able to identify the most critical causal factors for degraded performance conditions, in a way that is comprehensible to an analyst. We will provide a user interface to explore the model results and causal factors. This work will support planning for UAM operations as well as informing NASA and other stakeholders where further investments in NAS automation are most warranted.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        ames-research-center",NA,NA
"686","Fast Acting Flow Control Valve, Phase I","High power electric propulsion systems have the potential to revolutionize space propulsion due to their extremely high performance.  This can result in significant propellant savings on space vehicles, allowing the overall mass to shrink for launch on a less expensive vehicle or to allow the space vehicle to carry more payload at the same weight.  Many of the electrical propulsion systems operate in pulse mode, pulsing hundreds or even thousands of times per second.  Creating reliable valves that can operate in pulse mode for extremely long life and at low power are critical in these applications.WASK Engineering will develop a normally closed, piezo electric operated valve for application to pulsing electrical thrusters.  The benefits of such a valve includes 1) demonstrated ability to operate at frequencies from 0 Hz to 4,000 Hz, 2) ability to throttle continuously from 0-100% open, 3) extremely fast response, 4) low power usage, 5) infinitely variable valve operating waveforms, sine wave, square wave, saw tooth, custom wave form, etc., 6) no EMI generated, 7) very small size provides options when locating valve, 8) demonstrated ability to operate at pressures exceeding 1,000 psi, and 9) very low part count for reliability.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA

The flight-like drill prototype that was the end result of the project successfully drilled and acquired 1 cm³ samples from a variety of rocks and soils including the hardest anticipated Martian rock (basalt) and frozen soil. This ability was demonstrated not only in ambient conditions but also in a thermal/vacuum chamber replicating Mars pressure and extreme temperatures. The rotary percussive approach is simple, robust, and highly efficient with regards to power and mass.During the SBIR 2006 Phase I effort, Alliance took this heritage device and expanded its potential to include coring against a variety of rock materials anticipated to be encountered on Mars. Through the use of a breadboard fixture, coring bit designs and coring parameters were evaluated to identify optimum combinations. At the completion of test a conceptual design was generated taking this coring experience into account and adding core retention, break and ejection features. A bit change mechanism, identified as a requirement for successful operation while maintaining design robustness and simplicity, was added as well.A Phase II effort is now proposed that will take this conceptual design into prototype form. Primary activities to be performed during Phase II will include:•   Additional coring test runs to work out final details of detail bit design•   Detail design and prototyping of core handling mechanisms•   Prototype testing of core handling mechanisms•   Design and manufacture of full prototype LSAS Corer system•   Testing of prototype LSAS corer•   Integration of LSAS corer onto robotic platform and functional demonstration","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

Each XRS observation results in four X-ray spectra. When an X-ray interacts with one of the four detectors, a charge or voltage pulse is generated. This signal is converted into one of 2^8 (256) channels, which are correlated to energy. Over a commanded integration time period a histogram of counts as a function of energy (channel number) is recorded. The EDRs are the number of events in each channel of the four detectors accumulated over the integration period. Channels above or below the useful energy range of the detectors are not transmitted. The result is three 244-channel GPC histograms and one 231-channel solar monitor histogram, each of which is designated as a single X-ray spectrum. Each observation is calibrated and processed into the CDR data set. For each CDR whose field of view is contained or partially contained on the planetary surface, a footprint is computed that corresponds to the perimeter of the planetary region within the instrument field of view during the integration time of the observation.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","mercury                        messenger","Earth Science",NA
"691","A Space-Qualified Single Frequency Fiber Laser for LISA, Phase I","Single frequency high power lasers have been considered to be an enabling technology for NASA's Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, an ultra low noise high power (> 1W, scalable to 10W) single frequency (< 1 KHz) fiber laser source to meet with the requirement of solicitation. It is a specialty fiber based MOPA. The mode selection in seed laser is achieved by using a fiber based ultra narrow bandpass filter. The side mode suppression ratio can thus be suppressed over 80 dB. In the amplifier stage, our unique spectral shaping technology enables us to reduce the SBS and ASE noise significantly by using a commercially available YDF and reuse the residual pump to further increase the efficiency. Radiation hardness will be intensively studied in selection of space qualified fibers and components. A tabletop experiment will be demonstrated in Phase I time frame for proof of concept. A compact prototype will be delivered in Phase II meeting major space qualification such as radiation hardness.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"699","Topography improvements in MEMS DMs for high-contrast, high-resolution imaging, Phase II","We propose to develop a 3064 actuator, continuous facesheet MEMS deformable mirror using a modified fabrication process that will eliminate mid-spatial frequency surface figure errors resulting from actuator ""print-through"" topography and stress-induced mirror scallop topography. These figure errors, which occur at spatial frequencies outside the DM control band, are the most significant technological development hurdle preventing the use of MEMS DMs in proximity glare suppression for astronomical coronagraphy. Such wavefront control devices fill a critical technology gap in NASA's vision for high-contrast, high-resolution space based imaging and spectroscopy instruments. Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed MEMS DMs that represents the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. These DMs can be currently produced with uncorrectable shape errors as small as 10nm root mean square (rms). The residual shape errors on the DM are mostly periodic and act essentially as a grating, producing diffraction spikes in the image plane. In the Phase I effort, DM fabrication process modifications were developed which will enable the manufacture of these enabling components with an unprecedented surface figure of less than 2nm rms by eliminating surface features resulting from print-through , etch access holes, and mirror attachment posts, and compensating for residual stress induced scalloping.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

Meeting the demanding specifications of each design is complicated by the fact that certain layers in the fabrication (such as the superconducting device layer that determines operation temperature) are common to the three arrays, limiting the design space. Additionally, the presence of the different device scales presents a challenge to wiring of the array and the need to develop a low crosstalk crossover method for sorting the array into region that can share common bias of its pixels.  The second phase of the work will focus on improving the heatsinking in these arrays.  The heatsinking will be added last so that it can be varied in properties and heatsunk regions can be segregated.  While more open-ended, this research will explore how improvements in practical array performance can be achieved.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates.

"714","Microarray Profile of Gene Expression during Osteoclast Differentiation in Modeled Microgravity","Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV) Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun c-Fos PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs Houston TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem Inc.

"716","Phonon Recycling for Ultrasensitive Kinetic Inductance Detectors","Initially proposed (Day et al. 2003; Zmuidzinas 2012) in 1999 by our Caltech/JPL group, and thanks to strong support from NASA, the superconducting (microwave) kinetic inductance detector (MKID or KID) technology continues to develop rapidly as it transitions into applications. The development effort worldwide is intensifying and NASA’s continued support of KID development is essential in order to keep pace.Here we propose to investigate and demonstrate a new, low–TRL concept, which we call phonon recycling, that promises to open broad new avenues in KID design and performance. Briefly, phonon recycling allows the detector designer to tailor the responsivity and sensitivity of a KID to match the needs of the application by using geometry to restrict the rate at which recombination phonons are allowed to escape from the detector. In particular, phonon recycling should allow very low noise-equivalent power (NEP) to be achieved without requiring very low operating tem- peratures. Phonon recycling is analogous to the use of micromachined suspension legs to control the flow of heat in a bolometer, as measured by the thermal conductivity G. However, phonon recycling exploits the non-thermal distribution of recombination phonons as well as their very slow decay in crystals at low temperatures. These properties translate to geometrical and mechanical requirements for a phonon-recycled KID that are considerably more relaxed than for a bolometer operating at the same temperature and NEP.Our ultimate goal is to develop detector arrays suitable for a far–infrared (FIR) space mission, which will impose strict requirements on the array sensitivity, yield, uniformity, multiplexing density, etc. Through previous NASA support under the Strategic Astrophysics Technology (SAT) program, we have successfully demonstrated the MAKO submillimeter camera at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and have become familiar with these practical issues. If our demonstration of phonon recycling is successful, we will have a path for continuously adapting the high–background, high–NEP detectors we have demonstrated on the ground to the ultralow–NEP detectors needed for space.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"717","High Fidelity Tool for Turbulent Combustion in Liquid Launch Propulsion Systems Based on Spray-Flamelet Methodology, Phase I","The innovation proposed here is a high-performance, high-fidelity simulation capability for simulating liquid rocket spray combustion based on a novel spray-flamelet methodology which will be integrated into Loci-STREAM which is a CFD solver developed by the proposing personnel under funding from NASA over the last several years. A new spray-flamelet formulation will be incorporated into Loci-STREAM. The particular advantages of this formulation are (i) its consistency with the single-phase flamelet-formulation (already available in Loci-STREAM), (ii) its formulation in mixture-fraction space, overcoming the non-uniqueness of the classical mixture-fraction parameterization, and (iii) its applicability to finite Stokes-number, thereby accounting for particle evaporation, slip-velocity, and poly-dispersed spray-phase. The flamelet methodology already available in Loci-STREAM  in conjunction with Hybrid RANS-LES (HRLES) methodology  has facilitated an order of magnitude improvement in simulation turnaround times for NASA applications involving complex physics in 3D geometries. This project is aimed at extending this flamelet methodology to spray combustion resulting in a state-of-the-art design and analysis tool to enable accurate, fast and robust simulations of multiphase combustion in liquid rocket engines (involving liquid propellants such as LOX and LH2/LCH4/RP-1/RP-2), combustion stability analysis, etc. which constitute critical components of NASA's upper stage launch propulsion systems","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA
"718","Picometer-Resolution MEMS Segmented DM, Phase I","Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology has the potential to create deformable mirrors (DM) with 10^4 actuators that have size, weight, and power specifications that are far lower than conventional piezoelectric and electrostrictive DMs. However, building a MEMS DM with a relatively large aperture that is flat in the unpowered state is challenging. Currently, a large portion of the mirror stroke must be used to flatten the MEMS DMs and in some cases, the DM stroke is not even sufficient to flatten the mirror. In the case of the large-stroke segmented MEMS DMs manufactured by Iris AO, there is sufficient stroke for wavefront correction after flattening. However, the resolution is significantly reduced because the dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converters (DAC) used to operate the DM is spread over multiple microns of stroke rather than the 0.5 µm range required to correct for aberrations in the telescope that feeds the coronagraph.This Phase I SBIR will make substantial improvements in the fabrication process of MEMS segmented DMs that reduce the deleterious residual surface-figure errors. It will do so by systematically addressing the sources of the segment position variations as well as addressing low-spatial frequency chip bow that can result in large peak-to-valley deformations across the DM array. The Iris AO DM architecture will also be modified to enable picometer resolution actuation with ultra-precision drive electronics.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

Ground testing capability that can reproduce degradation of sensors observed in the low Mars orbital environment needs to be developed to enable designers to test sensor materials and components prior to flight.It is important to invest in this proposal because we are venturing farther into the solar system where spacecraft are too distant to be easily repaired if something goes wrong. We need to be able to simulate the low Mars orbital environment here so that we select sensor materials that we know will survive a Mars mission prior to launch. It is known that Mars upper atmosphere contains atomic oxygen, but the Mars upper atmosphere is much harsher than was originally thought. Langmuir probe sensor surfaces tested under Low Earth Orbit (LEO) atomic oxygen conditions for the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission, which performed under LEO environment conditions, experienced unexpected loss in performance in low Mars orbit.The goal is to understand the cause of degradation of Langmuir probe and other sensor materials observed on the MAVEN spacecraft and develop a capability to simulate the degradation on the ground to enable development of Mars environment durable sensors.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

"743","Virtual Sensors: Efficiently Estimating Missing Spectra","Various instruments are used to create images of the Earth and other objects in the universe in a diverse set of wavelength bands with the aim of understanding natural phenomena. Sometimes these instruments are built in a phased approach, with additional measurement capabilities added in later phases. In other cases, technology may mature to the point that the instrument offers new measurement capabilities that were not planned in the original design of the instrument. In still other cases, high resolution spectral measurements may be too costly to perform on a large sample and therefore lower resolution spectral instruments are used to take the majority of measurements. Many applied science questions that are relevant to the earth science remote sensing community require analysis of enormous amounts of data that were generated by instruments with disparate measurement capabilities. This paper addresses this problem using Virtual Sensors: a method that uses modelstrained on spectrally rich (high spectral resolution) data to ""fill in"" unmeasured spectral channels in spectrally poor (low spectral resolution) data. The models we use in this paper are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels and SVMs with Mixture Density Mercer Kernels (MDMK). We demonstrate this method by using models trained on the high spectral resolution Terra MODIS instrument to estimate what the equivalent of the MODIS 1.6 micron channel would be for the NOAA AVHRR/2 instrument. The scientific motivation for the simulation of the 1.6 micron channel is to improve the ability of the AVHRR/2 sensor to detect clouds over snow and ice.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

In fact, solid state lighting, high-temperature and high-power electronics, microelectronic and mechanical sensors, and high-efficiency solar cells are all poised at a new level of development. This enormous market is waiting for low-cost, high quality substrates to achieve performance and fabrication economies of scale. After achieving dislocation densities below 1E7 cm-2 in the phase I work, this NASA SBIR phase II project addresses the development of a dislocation filter that can routinely prepare low-stress GaN thin films with threading dislocation densities below 1E6 cm-2. The method relies on using a low-angle ion beam to induce both nanofilter for defect reductions and to inhibit droplet formation at low growth temperatures. Dislocation densities have so far been determined by standard etch pit densities method. The goal the project to optimize the multiple defect nanofilter with smoothening by transition layers in between filters to reduce the TD to less than 1E6 cm-2 and process, fabricate high performance HEMT for solid state high power amplifier (SSPA) applications. To obtain a more practical evaluation of the effectiveness and commercial viability of the method, heterojunction field effect transistors with high electron mobility will be fabricated in these ultra-low defect density films. These high-quality material based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) will enable high linearity power amplifiers with excellent thermal stability and frequency response. The proposed method to grow on low-stress, low-dislocation density films will lead to the production of electronic devices of unparalleled performance.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA
"748","Development of Small-Volume, High-Precision, and Reliable Cryogenic Linear Actuators by Using Novel Intermetallic Compounds","Space missions often involve ultra-cold environments, and cryogenic actuators must be mechanically robust for long-term cyclic work, generate high power per volume, as well as perform high precision motion in such extreme environments. These demanding requirements have asked a material scientist to seek for a new type of actuator materials. Recently, we discovered a bulk-scale novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 that can exhibit superelastic deformation and ultra-high strength, which leads to unusually high actuation power per volume, 10~1000 times larger than most actuator materials, as well as cryogenic linear shape memory effects even near 0 K. The cryogenic linear actuation of this crystal is exceptionally repeatable, precise, and reliable with almost no fatigue damage, which would guarantee the long lifetime and high accuracy in actuation motion. Therefore, the research objective of this proposal is to develop a small-volume, high-precision and mechanically-robust cryogenic linear actuator by performing the combined set of works that include (1) large single crystal growth of novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 and related structures, (2) evaluation of their cryogenic linear actuation performance, (3) understanding of fundamental physics behind cryogenic actuation properties, and (4) development of proto-type linear actuators that operates at a temperature between 4 and 150 K.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        the-university-of-c...",NA,NA
"749","Thioaptamer Diagnostic System, Phase I","AM Biotechnologies (AM) will develop a diagnostic system in response to SBIR Topic X10.01 Reusable Diagnostic Lab Technology that will simultaneously detect and quantify numerous protein biomarkers with excellent sensitivity.  AM will enhance the current clinical gold standard immunoassay methodology by using its proprietary bead-based aptamer selection process to select dithiophosphate backbone-modified (PS2) ""thio"" aptamers (PS2-thioaptamers) as replacements for antibodies in immunoassays.  The PS2-thioaptamers are binding agents with functionality comparable to antibodies but with very long shelf-life under ambient environment storage.  The PS2-thioaptamers bind much more tightly to their targets than regular aptamers without sacrificing specificity, and are much more nuclease resistant.  AM's bead-based process allows fast selection and identification of PS2-thioaptamers, which cannot be directly selected using older aptamer technologies such as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX).  AM will demonstrate PS2-thioaptamer integration into a state-of-the-art microfluidics instrument from Sandia National Laboratory that meets NASA's form factor needs for space flight.  The Phase I Project will demonstrate detection and quantification of osteocalcin (OC) using a PS2-thioaptamer in a prototype microfluidics device (TRL-4).

"754","Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) Data from the Harvard 2003 Campaign","The AIRMISR_HARVARD_2003 data set was asquired during a flight over the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA, target as part of the AirMISR deployments from the Wallops Flight Facility during the August 2003 campaign. This particular flight took place on August 24, 2003. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. There were a total of two runs during this flight. A run comprises data collected from nine view angles acquired on a fixed flight azimuth angle. Each data file from one run contains either: a) Level 1B1 Radiometric product from one of the 9 camera angles or b) Level 1B2 Georectified radiance product from one of the 9 camera angles. Browse images in PNG format are available for the Level 1B1 product and browse images in JPEG format are available for the Level 1B2 product. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aft For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2). The Level 1 Radiometric product contains data that are scaled to convert the digital output of the cameras to radiances and are conditioned to remove instrument-dependent effects. Additionally, all radiances are adjusted to remove slight spectral sensitivity differences among the detector elements of each spectral band.

"756","Global Aerosol Measurement System","The Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is developing a new, low cost satellite capability for measuring the properties and distributions of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (collectively, the UTLS).  This altitude region is important because there have been observed increases in the amount of particles in the UTLS.  These particles typically reflect sunlight back into space and cool the Earth.  GAMS will measure the altitudes and amounts of these particles by looking to the side of the spacecraft, through the thickness of Earth’s atmosphere, and provide detailed information about how particles are changing in the UTLS. The goal of the Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is to develop needed technologies and obervation strategies to optimally measure the distributions and properties of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).  The GAMS concept is based on the limb-scattering measurement techniques used on past sensors, most directly from the heritage of the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP) currently flying on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) spacecraft.  OMPS-LP was launched on Suomi NPP in 2011, with the next planned launch of this instrument in 2022 on the next generation Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2).  Because of the length of time between the NPP and JPSS-2 launches there is the potential for a significant data gap for these important measurements.  The GAMS concept is intended to be a simple and low cost measurement system that could be ready to fill such a gap. The current OMPS-LP system measures light reflected by particles in the UTLS by looking behind the Suomi NPP path, looking through the thickness of Earth’s atmosphere (i.e., the limb).  Although OMPS-LP has proven capable of detecting the presence of background particles in the UTLS, as well as particles from volcanic eruptions and meteorites entering Earth’s atmosphere from space, it has very limited spatial coverage and suffers from sensitivity issues since it preferentially sees particles in one direct with respect to the sun.  GAMS seeks to overcome both limitations by making measurements of reflected light In two or more directions relative to the spacecraft flight.  Because GAMS focuses only on the limb profiling capabilities (versus the more comprehensive by more complicated OMPS system) it can be contained in a relatively smaller spacecraft, which will reduce deployment costs.  Additional increased spatial coverage can be realized by flying multiple copies of the GAMS instrument in different orbits. At this stage of the GAMS project we are refining science requirements and measurement capabilities.  Working with simulations of Earth’s atmosphere from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric model we are refining both the number of viewing directions and the number of spectral channels needed to adequately measure the particles in the UTLS.  Engineering work is being performed to refine the GAMS measurement strategy, focused on detector design.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"758","Broadband Electrically Tunable Monolithic Mid-Infrared Laser","Mid-Infrared spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for chemical detection and identification. While single frequency lasers have been used previously for single chemical detection in NASA missions, a broadly tunable laser offers the possibility to detect a large number of chemicals with a single source. This is invaluable for providing maximum functionality in a limited footprint. Current broadly tunable mid-infrared laser systems utilize one or more laser gain chips and mechanical external cavity tuning in order to span a wide spectral range. This technique is sensitive to mechanical shock and has a limited tuning speed. Our goal is to replace these systems with a compact source that is electrically tunable and mechanically robust. This is a potentially transformative technology that will dramatically improve both SWaP and reliability for future NASA missions. The main goal will be accomplished via three main research tracks: 1) Engineering a broadband gain medium based on quantum cascade laser technology; 2) Development of a multi-section, electrically tunable laser design for the mid-infrared; 3) On-chip beam combining and amplification for high power and excellent beam quality.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

Metal mesh filters, based on a free-standing sheet of metal with a periodic area of apertures, have been used for many years. However, they have proven to be extremely difficult and costly to fabricate and are not presently available over a large part of the terahertz frequency band (100 GHz through 10 THz). Also, the terahertz filters that are available from commercial suppliers tend to have unacceptable loss in the pass-band (20% or more) and often cost over one thousand dollars per filter. Through this program VDI is developing new fabrication processes and mesh designs that will improve performance and greatly reduce costs. Successful completion of this program will make the filters available for NASA's terahertz missions, facilitate the development of improved terahertz detectors (by facilitating bolometer calibration and testing) and also make the filters commercially available for the greater range of terahertz applications that are now emerging, such as imaging systems and spectrometers.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"767","Modular Magnetic Mobile Manipulators for Microgravity Environments","The proposed research utilizes novel omnidirectional electromagnets capable of on-line reconfiguration, called Omnimagnets, currently in development at the University of Utah. An Omnimagnet is a cube with no moving parts, capable of real-time control of the magnitude and orientation of its magnetic field. If a magnetic tool is introduced in an Omnimagnet’s magnetic field, the Omnimagnet can dexterously manipulate the tool’s position and orientation. This method of manipulation is unlike any other telerobotic manipulation technique. In space, Omnimagnets will be able to manipulate each other and their separate magnetic tools, utilizing magnetic forces and torques that go beyond simple attraction and repulsion. By fixing to various spacecraft or satellite surfaces, Omnimagnets can walk across surfaces and magnetically carry tools large distances, using inchworm inspired approaches. Thus, Omnimagnets can deliver tools to the worksite and then manipulate those tools, potentially enabling safer and more cost-effective procedures. Satellite repair, debris removal from convoluted hard-to-reach structures, and assembly of structures in microgravity are some of the challenges that Omnimagnets and their tools will tackle in space. Like other manipulation systems operating in space (e.g., Robonaut 2, SmartSPHERES), Omnimagnets will be able to relieve astronauts of both tedious routine maintenance tasks and highly dangerous extra-vehicular activity. Magnetic manipulation and inchworm locomotion in microgravity is a unique approach to coordinated motion that may contribute to other mobile manipulation projects. The design is also modular, allowing for Omnimagnets of various sizes and attachment mechanisms to work together to manipulate a diverse set of tools in a variety of environments. Furthermore, Omnimagnet manipulation will be safe for operation with and around humans, with no internally moving parts, low forces, and slow manipulation speeds. This project will involve: (1) the development of models and simulations of multiple Omnimagnets in a variety of manipulation scenarios; (2) the design and construction of a set of Omnimagnets, as well as a tool for the Omnimagnets to manipulate; (3) the development of a localization method for the Omnimagnets and their tools based on magnetic and range-finding techniques; (4) the construction of an aquarium to simulate microgravity, and attached air-filled containers to make the Omnimagnets and tool neutrally buoyant; (5) the experimental demonstration of manipulation techniques with the set of Omnimagnets and the tool using direct telemanipulation; and (6) the algorithm development and experimental demonstration of supervised autonomous control, in which the low-level Omnimagnet control is handled in software to achieve the human user’s desired high-level commands.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed",NA,NA

The proposed system uses commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) components to create a distributed sensor array for the measurement of shear stress in either a flight or ground test environment.  The reusable sensor array requires no external wiring or power source.  The bio-inspired system is based on mimicking the sensitivity and response of a single hair fiber/receptor neuron to sense flow velocity very near a surface.  An array of the hair cell inspired shear sensors are embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate, which also contains a self-contained, battery operated acquisition system.  The self-contained blanket array can be quickly and easily applied to aircraft or vehicle surfaces in question.  No wiring, external power, or control is required.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  In addition to measurement of shear stress, the sensor array should be able to determine laminar/turbulent boundary-layer transition locations, laminar/turbulent separation and reattachment lines, and shock locations.

In previous work for the Department of Energy involving fusion reactor components, Ultramet demonstrated the capability of an innovative heat exchanger composed of a highly porous, open-cell refractory metal foam coolant channel enclosed within a solid refractory metal shell of the same material. High heat flux testing with helium coolant was performed at the Sandia National Laboratories Plasma Materials Test Facility. A component survived heat flux levels up to 22.36 MW/m2 (2236 W/cm2). The turbulence created by flowing helium coolant through highly porous open-cell foam dramatically increased heat transfer relative to a conventional open coolant channel.

"778","Lightweight Superconducting Magnets for Low Temperature Magnetic Coolers, Phase I","NASA's future science missions to investigate the structure and evolution of the universe require efficient, very low temperature coolers for low noise detector systems.  We propose to develop a highly efficient, lightweight Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigeration (AMRR) system that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures of about 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K.  The AMRR system uses three novel design features to achieve a large cooling capacity and very high thermal efficiency: a vibration-free, reversible cryogenic circulator; innovative micromachined regenerators; and lightweight superconducting magnets.  The superconducting magnet uses low-current superconducting YBCO tapes and a unique winding arrangement to enable an AMRR to achieve high thermal efficiency. In Phase I, we will develop a design for the superconducting magnet and its electrical, thermal, and structural support subsystems.  Based on the performance characteristics of the magnet system, we will optimize the magnetic field in the AMRR to minimize the overall system size and mass.  In Phase II, we will build a superconducting magnet and demonstrate the performance of a magnetic regenerator driven by this magnet under prototypical conditions.  In Phase III, we will assemble an integrated AMRR system and demonstrate its performance.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"781","Self-Contained Portable Data Acquisition/Control System Unit for Hydrogen Environments","The platform is designed to be a self-contained unit that is built to support a wide variety of electrical equipment, and constructed so that it can be safely deployed within hydrogen environments. The unit takes advantage of recent advancements in computer technologies, and incorporates them for utilization throughout ground propulsion test facilities, eliminating the need for rebuilding existing systems. The unit is a practical field deployable tool that can be setup quickly throughout the facilities' hydrogen environments, and offers the capability for rapid deployment for instances when issues suddenly arise and facility Data Acquisition Control Systems (DACS) are not available. Additionally, the unit can independently operate equipment in the field for an extended duration (approximately 30 days).  The unit provides three major innovations: (1) the ability to effectively power, cool and purge electrical equipment in a self-contained intrinsically safe enclosure; (2) mobile equipment cooling capability for extended operational durations; and (3) employs a novel intrinsically safe instrumentation interconnection port.An independent equipment platform designed to support a wide variety of electrical equipment was encapsulated into a self-contained portable enclosure unit.  The unit was constructed for certified deployment within ""Class I, Division 2, Group B"" explosive environments).  The units employ a novel purging system with redundant tanks for ensuring external gases remain isolated from the unit's internal components.  The interior is continually monitored for a loss of positive purge pressure. Upon any loss of purge events, the system will immediately go into a safe state.   The units employ highly efficient coolers for actively removing interior heat through an external convection driven thermal heat exchanger.  The cooling system is highly effective for maintaining proper electronic operating temperatures while remaining safe for use within explosive environments.  A heavy duty but light weight case with roller and retractable handle features was modified to make portable air sealed enclosures for encapsulating the units.  The cases were equipped with external solar panel mounting rails, a viewing window, enhanced door seals, low pressure relief valves, and intrinsically safe wire ports which are custom made, and allow instrumentation, control, and network access interconnections to be hermetically sealed. The portable systems are easily setup for quick deployment for independent operation in hydrogen environments. The units may be left operational for up to thirty days with the existing battery. The system is automatically controlled by a custom built microprocessor control module.  The intelligent module links all the systems for performing real-time synchronized operations with a simple user interface panel.  The panel can be observed through a viewing window, and operated with magnetic scroll/enter switches.  The microprocessor module also provides basic operational event logging and basic cargo interface capabilities.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        stennis-space-center",NA,NA

The instruments will also prove useful for in situ surface analysis.  The first instrument (Instrument #1), based on fast extractive sampling, will record measurements of several important gas-phase constituents in regolith processing facilities with extraordinarily high sensitivity, accuracy and specificity in real time.  This instrument will integrate directly into NASA's hydrogen and carbothermal reduction test facilities at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The measurement quantities of interest include the concentrations of HF, HCl, H2S, O2, H2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and H2O isotopes (H2HO or HDO and H218O).  The second instrument (Instrument #2) will provide measurements of H2O concentrations and gas temperature directly in the high temperature reactive flow and prior to hydrolysis. The third instrument (Instrument #3) will provide accurate quantification of the aforementioned gases in a compact, low-power form factor suitable for integration into the Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) project.

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates.

"792","Automated Flight Safety Inference Engine (AFSIE) System, Phase I","We propose to develop an innovative Autonomous Flight Safety Inference Engine (AFSIE) system to autonomously and reliably terminate the flight of an errant launch vehicle. This proposed phase 1 research is innovative in that it combines proven NASA-developed AFS algorithms, real-time hazard assessment algorithms and hazard envelopes generated from Joint Advanced Range Safety System Real Time (JARSS RT)  and an on-board vehicle simulator into a refined onboard software inference engine that monitors navigation states, mission flight rules and onboard anomaly instrumentation.  An autonomous flight safety system must be able to reliably perform accurate and autonomous navigation so as to determine the vehicle position, velocity and attitude states in real time. Reliability requirements for AFS are high due to stringent loss-of-life constraints, often leading to redundant navigation sensors with attendant cost impacts. Our innovative solution proposes to satisfy RCC accuracy and reliability requirements by exploiting the low-cost COTS sensor and processor architectures that are currently being baselined for the Common NanoSat/Launcher Avionics Technology (CNAT) study and a Nano launch vehicle avionics design. This dual use hardware implementation will greatly reduce the recurring costs for the production of an autonomous flight safety system.   This has significant implications for reducing the costs for launch vehicles, particularly Nano and Micro Satellite Launch Vehicles (NMSLV), where range safety costs currently consume a burdensome percentage of the launch cost.  Under this proposed phase 1 effort, we will 1) identify the range requirements and develop a plan for range safety for approval of the system, 2) identify reliable low-cost COTS hardware that satisfies the range accuracy and reliability requirements and, 3) develop an end to end simulation to demonstrate the AFSIE Concept of Operations.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        kennedy-space-center",NA,NA

"795","Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk","Age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is an important consideration when modeling the carcinogenesis process or estimating cancer risks. Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular particularly DNA damage. However during middle-age the incidence begins to decelerate and for many tumor sites it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z) high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old) which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals) with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis the key players FASN AKT1 and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex were determined to be contributory. In sum these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice 8 samples from young irradiated mice 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen) quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion) and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina) and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina).

"796","Two Scan Heads are Better Than One: Integration of a Second Scan Pedestal for Co-manifesting CoSMIR, CoSSIR, and/or HyMAS","Simultaneous observations of atmospheric water vapor, temperature and clouds are essential to improving climate and weather models. Measurements of cloud ice and precipitation profiles and stheir microphysical properties are required to unravel the coupling between the Earth’s hydrologic cycle (precipitation) and radiative energy budget processes. Understanding the coupling between clouds and precipitation, and Earth’s energy budget and hydrological cycle are goals embedded within the Aerosol, Cloud, and Ecosystems (ACE) mission and the Cloud and Precipitation Process Mission (CaPPM). This IRAD bridges a critical gap in Goddard’s airborne millimeter and submillimeter-wave cloud remote sensing by assembling a second scan pedestal for CoSMIR, CoSSIR, and HyMAS radiometers to operate jointly. The second scan pedestal will enable two of the three radiometers to fly concurrently, e.g. co-manifested on NASA’s ER-2 research aircraft, providing an unprecedented range of microwave spectral coverage for cloud, precipitation, temperature and water vapor measurements. By demonstrating these capabilities on research aircraft, NASA will reduce the risk for deploying millimeter and submillimeter radiometers on future spaceflight missions. The Compact Scanning Microwave Imaging Radiometer (CoSMIR) was originally developed as a calibration and validation instrument for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. CoSMIR has channels spanning 51 GHz and 183 GHz. Its novel azimuth over elevation dual-axes gimbals permit contiguous conical and across-track imaging with interleaved hot/cold calibration. CoSMIR currently serves as the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) simulator. The Compact Scanning Submm-wave Imaging Radiometer (CoSSIR) has channels spanning 183 GHz and 870 GHz and operates using the same scan pedestal as CoSMIR.  CoSSIR has pioneered the application of submillimeter-wave radiometric sensing of ice clouds contributing vital data leading to the inclusion of the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) on ESA’s next generation MetOp satellite (due to launch in 2022). Its measurements were the impetus for selection of IceCube, a cubesat technology demonstration of 900 GHz receiver technology with a planned International Space Station release in 2016.The Hyperspectral Microwave Atmospheric Sounder (HyMAS) is an Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO)  funded instrument developed in partnership with MIT Lincoln Laboratory and is designed to use the CoSMIR/CoSSIR scan pedestal. HyMAS is a highly innovative hyperspectral sounder with fifty-two channels spanning the 118 GHz oxygen and 183 GHz water vapor lines. The completion of integration and laboratory testing is anticipated to be complete in September 2015.At present, there is only one pedestal that accommodates the CoSMIR, CoSSIR, and HyMAS scanheads.  These instruments cannot be flown together since they share the same infrastructure; the scan pedestal includes basic mounting of the scan head, the scanning mechanism and control electronics (conical and cross-track), two blackbody calibrators and calibration/house keeping computer, aircraft interface, and data acquisition and systems.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"798","High Efficiency Semiconductor Arrays for Hard X-Ray Imaging, Phase I","The next generation of wide-field survey instruments with improved angular and energy resolution for research into astrophysical transient X-ray phenomena is currently under development. A scalable detector plane architecture has been developed at Harvard using CZT detector arrays for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.Despite decades of research, the yield of device grade CZT is still quite low. In addition, internal defects cause spatial distortions in images. To meet the needs of hard X-ray astronomy a lower cost, more uniform and more readily available alternative to CZT is desirable.Thallium bromide (TlBr) has higher density and atomic number than CZT and therefore higher stopping power at hard X-ray energies. TlBr has a low melting point (460 ⁰C, compared to ~ 1100 ⁰C for CZT) and cubic crystal structure and can be grown from the melt by low cost techniques. As a result, TlBr has the potential to be a more efficient, lower cost alternative to CZT in the detector plane architecture developed by Harvard for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"799","A Heat Switch for Space Applications, Phase I","Various planned NASA missions require heat switches for active thermal control. As an example cryocoolers, including redundant coolers are incorporated on select missions. The redundant coolers operate when deteriorating or defunct coolers are deactivated. However, integration of redundant coolers may cause substantial parasitic heat loads unless the cold regions are thermally connected to the active cryocooler only. The overall system efficiency will depend in part on the efficacy of the intervening heat switches. We propose to develop a highly effective, innovative prototype heat switch that combines two recently developed technologies. First, it employs a highly conductive thermal contact at a low applied force. Secondly, the heat switch employs an innovative bi-stable actuator. The actuator requires little energy to switch between states and can achieve motion on the order of millimeters. This available motion exceeds the tens to hundreds of microns needed to engage the contact, enabling complete separation, and thus, excellent thermal isolation in the off state. Combining the inherently high on- and low off-conductance of the contacts with the bi-stable actuator positioning provides for a highly effective, innovative heat switch, potentially enabling significant performance enhancement of NASA missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        kennedy-space-center",NA,NA

Eight adjustable parameters, three echo height thresholds and five radar reflectivity thresholds, are used to optimize the performance of the algorithm. Optimum performance is time consuming and requires an analyst to select different sets of parameters on a per volume scan basis, and on occasions performing several iterations while adjusting one or more of the parameters.A key component of the TRMM project is the Ground Validation (GV) effort which consists of collecting data from ground-based radar, rain gauges and disdrometers.

The state of the art active deicing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. With the advent of icephobic nanocoatings, there have been attempts to develop a durable passive anti-ice coating. However, success to date has been limited. The state of the art can be advanced if anti-ice coatings can be made more durable, and are made to function synergistically with active de-icing techniques. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. Working in collaboration with a manufacturer of low power ice protection systems for commercial and military aircraft, we propose in Phase I to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating a durable anti-ice coating with an active deicing device. The proposed program builds upon NEI's core competency of introducing desirable functionalities into engineered coatings. The anti-ice/deicing performance will be tested at our collaborator's icing wind tunnel. The objective of the Phase II program will be to further refine the coating composition and coating deposition process, as well as the configuration of the baseline active deicing device so as to deliver a working prototype of an integrated ice protection system that combines a passive anti-ice coating and an active deicing device.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

The CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) team proposes an inflatable airlock structure that employs unique fabric architecture capable of delivering the lowest mass and greatest versatility of any competing design. The proposed fabric inflatable airlock design features a completely integrated air beam inter-wall to passively generate the wall stiffness required for airlock depressurizationwithout the mass and bulk of aluminum pressure hulls or complexity of multi-structure adaptations of competing inflatable habitat architectures. The design is a modification of Thin Red Line Aerospace's (TRLA) patented Ultra High Performance Pressure Vessel (UHPV), the only fabric pressure vessel design with fully determinate load paths which allows for true mass optimization. This unique architecture utilizes a matrix of braided fiber tendons to contain the structure's global pressure loads. The underlying woven fabric and gas barrier envelopes are thereby only exposed to minimal local shell loads where they bulge outwards between adjacent tendons. Working in pure tension in the absence of load coupling, the tendon array architecture has been shown to be statically determinate and auto-stabilizing under extreme deflection. The proposed fabric inflatable airlock stows compactly for transport to the habitat further reducing logistic costs.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

NASA and other aerospace research centers are involved in developing advanced numerical algorithms for strategic traffic flow management. These algorithms can be invoked at fixed time intervals, or can be employed whenever adverse traffic flow conditions occur. In order to avoid spurious responses, the control algorithms should be used only when actual traffic flow problems are likely to arise, and not in response to normal flow variations. Queuing models describe the aggregate stochastic behavior of the national airspace, and can provide not only mean flow characteristics, but also the expected variations.

"823","Autonomous Task Primitives for Complex Manipulation Operations","The goal of this research effort is to enable robots to autonomously perform the complex manipulation tasks that are necessary to maintain a spacecraft. Robots, like NASA's Robonaut 2 (R2), could assist  human spaceflight by freeing the crew's time for more valuable activities and helping astronauts with dangerous and time-consuming tasks. These tasks include setting up and tearing down extra-vehicular activities (EVA) sites, changing air filters, and taking environmental samples on the International Space Station (ISS). Many of these tasks require tool use, dexterous manipulation, reasoning about the physics of contact, and collaboration with astronauts; e.g. handing off tools.Manipulators are currently only capable of performing these actions through direct teleoperation. Teleoperation has been successful in explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) and surgical robots, but the expertise and bandwidth required is tremendous: only trained EOD technicians and surgeons can operate these robots effectively, and it consumes all of their attention and time. These flaws are especially problematic during spaceflight because bandwidth is limited, latency is high, and communication dropouts are common. For example, ground controllers must carefully schedule remote teleoperation of R2 around ISS's KU band dropouts and continuously monitor KU band coverage during teleoperation. Our goal is to reduce the expertise and bandwidth required for manipulation by providing an extensible vocabulary of task primitives. For example, the operator could command the robot to stow everything in this box in storage, flip that switch, or pick up that drill. As a consequence, the complexity of planning and controlling the robot is abstracted away from the user, reducing bandwidth and allowing the user to focus on higher-level mission planning.This abstraction puts the burden of planning and executing complex manipulation primitives squarely on the shoulders of the robot. A vocabulary of primitives may be easily repurposed to a broad range of missions and could be reused on similar robots. Primitives are also naturally extensible: as the capabilities of the robot increase over time, so does the richness of its vocabulary. Finally, robust task primitives are an important step towards achieving fully autonomous manipulation in the long term. Primitive actions can be combined by high level planner to achieve more complex tasks without human intervention.Our goal is to implement and evaluate the task primitives on R2, and eventually, in space. As an intermediate step we will evaluate these primitives on HERB, a mobile manipulator designed by the Personal Robotics Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University. Testing the primitives on HERB will insure that they generalize between robots and allow us to quickly evaluate their performance without spending valuable time on R2. We will then evaluate the primitives on R2 through close collaboration with Dr. Myron Diftler and the Robonaut group at Johnson Space Center. In contrast to HERB, R2 has high degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic hands and operates both on Earth and in microgravity. In the long term, these task primitives could be deployed onto the R2 stationed on ISS. We are confident that developing a library of robust task primitives would reduce the need for direct teloperation and enable R2 to complete complex manipulation operations both on Earth and in microgravity.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","carnegie-mellon-uni...                        completed",NA,NA

"826","Knowledge-Based System to Support Plug Load Management","Electrical plug loads comprise an increasingly larger share of building energy consumption as improvements have been made to Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems. It is anticipated that plug loads will account for a significant portion of the energy consumption of Sustainability Base, a recently constructed high-performance office building at NASA Ames Research Center. Consequently, monitoring plug loads will be critical to achieve energy efficient operations. In this paper we describe the development of a knowledge-based system to analyze data collected from a plug load management system that allows for metering and control of individual loads. Since Sustainability Base was not yet occupied at the time of this investigation, the study was conducted in another building on the Ames campus to prototype the system. The paper focuses on the knowledge engineering and verification of a modular software system that promotes efficient use of office building plug loads. The knowledge-based system generates summary usage reports and alerts building personnel of malfunctioning equipment and unexpected plug load consumption. The system is planned to be applied to Sustainability Base and is expected to identify malfunctioning loads and reduce building energy consumption.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

"829","Automated Discovery of Flight Track Anomalies","As new technologies are developed to handle the complexities of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), it is increasingly important to address both current and future safety concerns along with the operational, environmental, and efficiency issues within the National Airspace System (NAS). In recent years, the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) safety offices have been researching ways to utilize the many safety databases maintained by the FAA, such as those involving flight recorders, radar tracks, weather, and many other high-volume sensors, in order to monitor this unique and complex system. Although a number of current technologies do monitor the frequency of known safety risks in the NAS, very few methods currently exist that are capable of analyzing large data repositories with the purpose of discovering new and previously unmonitored safety risks. While monitoring the frequency of known events in the NAS enables mitigation of already identified problems, a more proactive approach of finding unidentified issues still needs to be addressed. This is especially important in the proactive identification of new, emergent safety issues that may result from the planned introduction of advanced NextGen air traffic management technologies and procedures. Development of an automated tool that continuously evaluates the NAS to discover both events exhibiting flight characteristics indicative of safety-related concerns as well as operational anomalies will heighten the awareness of such situations in the aviation community and serve to increase the overall safety of the NAS. This paper discusses the extension of previous anomaly detection work to identify operationally significant flights within the highly complex airspace encompassing the New York area of operations, focusing on the major airports of Newark International (EWR), LaGuardia International (LGA), and John F. Kennedy International (JFK). In addition, flight traffic in the vicinity of Denver International (DEN) airport/airspace is also investigated to evaluate the impact on operations due to variances in seasonal weather and airport elevation. From our previous research, subject matter experts determined that some of the identified anomalies were significant, but could not reach conclusive findings without additional supportive data. To advance this research further, causal examination using domain experts is continued along with the integration of air traffic control (ATC) voice data to shed much needed insight into resolving which flight characteristic(s) may be impacting an aircraft's unusual profile. Once a flight characteristic is identified, it could be included in a list of potential safety precursors. This paper also describes a process that has been developed and implemented to automatically identify and produce daily reports on flights of interest from the previous day.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA
"830","Miniature Flexible Humidity Sensitive Patches for Space Suits, Phase I","Advanced space suit technologies demand improved, simplified, long-life regenerative sensing technologies, including humidity sensors, that exceed the performance of current commercial devices. Intelligent Optical Systems proposes to develop luminescence-based optical sensors to monitor relative humidity (RH). The proposed sensors will offer flexible packaging designs and outstanding performance at high RH levels and under water saturation. Miniature flexible humidity-sensitive patches, connected to an optoelectronics reader by an optical fiber, will allow great flexibility in fitting the sensor element into the space suit. The sensor materials will consist of a luminescent indicator, whose emission lifetime depends on humidity, supported in chemically and mechanically passive polymer film. Since measurements that rely on emission lifetime are insensitive to indicator bleaching, and fluctuations in the light source and/or the photodetector, the measurements will be reliable and stable. The advantages of using optical sensors include easy miniaturization, immunity to electric and electromagnetic fields, and amenability to multiplexing. In Phase I, we will develop and analytically characterize humidity-sensitive materials, and prepare flexible sensor patches. In Phase II, we will manufacture prototypes for aeronautic qualification and conduct extensive testing under simulated environmental conditions. Sensitive patches to O2 and CO2 interrogated by the same electronic unit could be incorporated.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

We plan to achieve this by integrating the internal discrete amplification device design that gave promising results and proved the concept of internal discrete amplification mechanism in the InP material system. The primary accomplishments from the Phase I effort would be the development of ultra low noise, high gain, low noise and low cross-talk & after pulsing near-infrared photodetectors and photodetector arrays sensitive in the 1550 nm and 1800 nm spectral region. The technology of internal discrete amplification enables the combination of high speed, very high gain and ultra low noise. This is possible because the internal discrete amplification nullifies the effect of impact ionization coefficients and prevents the edge break down, with high quantum efficiency and high speed of operation. These photodetectors can be used in eye-safe Lidar/Ladar, atmospheric sensing, 3D imaging, missile seekers, battlefield target identification and recognition system.

It consists of information for one molecular species for an entire Global Survey or Special Observation. TES Level 2 data contain retrieved species (or temperature) profiles at the observation targets and the estimated errors. The geolocation, quality, and some other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) are also provided. L2 modeled spectra are evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compares observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updates the atmospheric parameters.L2 standard product files include information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. A global survey consists of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits. Nadir and limb observations are in separate L2 files, and a single ancillary file is composed of data that are common to both nadir and limb files.A Nadir sequence with in the TES Global Survey is two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. The Nadir standard product consists of four files, where each file is composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations currently only use a single set of filter mix.A Limb sequence within the TES Global Survey is three high-resolution scans over the same limb locations. The Limb standard product will consist of four files, where each file will be composed of the Global Survey Limb observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Limb observations use a repeating sequence of filter wheel positions.Special Observations can only be scheduled during the 9 or 10 orbit gaps in the Global Surveys, and are conducted in any of three basic modes: stare, transect, step-and-stare. The mode used depends on the science requirement. See http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/instrument/special observations/ for details.A Global Survey consists of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 4,608 retrievals are performed (1,152 nadir retrievals and 1,152 retrievals in time ordered sequence for each limb observation). Each observation is the input for retrievals of species Volume Mixing Ratios (VMR), temperature profiles, surface temperature and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density and other diagnostic quantities.Each TES Level 2 standard product reports information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object is bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product can have a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging is employed. Also missing or bad retrievals are not reported. Each limb observation Limb 1, Limb 2 and Limb 3, are processed independently. Thus each limb standard product consists of three sets where each set consist of 1,152 observations. For TES, the swath object represents one of these sets. Thus each limb standard product consists of three swath objects, one for each observation, Limb 1, Limb 2, and Limb 3.The organization of data within the Swath object is based on a superset of the UARS pressure levels used to report concentrations of trace atmospheric gases. The reporting grid is the same pressure grid used for modeling. There are 87 reporting levels from 1211.53 hPa, which allows for very high surface pressure conditions, to 0.1 hPa, about 65 km. In addition, the products will report values directly at the surface when possible or at the observed cloud top level.

As the mission of space probes expands, the data rate to be transmitted increases, and effective, compact, methods of modulating the RF carrier with high-speed data become a critical necessity.  Passive MMIC modulation approaches introduce loss into the RF path and analog phase shifters in particular can exhibit significant shortcomings such as insertion loss variations and phase-shift range limitations. For more complex digital or hybrid modulation schemes, passive modulator components may also need elaborate calibration look-up tables to achieve desired phase and amplitude modulation accuracy with respect to process and temperature variations. Hittite has recently developed high-performance, active I/Q vector modulator MMICs for communication systems operating up to C-band, based on SiGe and GaAs HBT process technologies.

The MAMRs use an innovative flow channel configuration and novel micromachining technologies to achieve very high thermal and flow performance.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating critical fabrication methods for the micromachined regenerator and its thermal and flow performance through detailed analysis.  In Phase II we will build and demonstrate a full-scale micromachined regenerator for a prototype AMRR system that can provide 50 mW of cooling near 2 K.

One-class Bayes learning such as one-class Naïve Bayes and one-class BayesianNetwork employs Bayes learning to build a classifier on the positive class only for discriminatingthe positive class and the negative class. It has been applied to anomaly detection for identifyingabnormal behaviors that deviate from normal behaviors. Because one-class Bayes classifiers canproduce probability score, which can be used for defining anomaly score for anomaly detection,they are preferable in many practical applications as compared with other one-class learningtechniques. However, previously proposed one-class Bayes classifiers might suffer from poorprobability estimation when the negative training examples are unavailable. In this paper, wepropose a new method to improve the probability estimation. The improved one-class Bayesclassifiers can exhibits high performance as compared with previously proposed one-class Bayesclassifiers according to our empirical results.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

"856","Real Time Monitoring and Test Vector Generation for Improved Flight Safety, Phase II","As the complexity of flight controllers grows so does the cost associated with verification and validation (V&V).  Current-generation controllers are reaching levels of complexity that push the envelopes of existing V&V approaches, and further increases in controller complexity are required to provide the operational capabilities desired for next generation systems. Without improved approaches, there is little hope for affordable V&V of next-generation intelligent systems and, unfortunately, controller validation is required to ensure the safety of these systems. Barron Associates proposes an aggressive plan of research to develop monitoring algorithms that estimate, in real time, safety margins of complex feedback systems based on observed differences between the model used for controller development and actual flight data.  The Phase II research will focus on the flight test environment where these algorithms will allow the flight test engineer to monitor and revise the test plan in real time - accelerating the test-matrix buildup when safety is assured and avoiding test points where safety is questionable.  The tool will also recommend test points that could help refine safety margin estimates for as yet unexecuted maneuvers. The result will be reduced flight test costs and improved safety.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"858","Many Manufactured Nanosats, Phase I","To achieve the capability to affordably produce scores of nano-spacecraft for envisioned constellation missions, a new manufacturing process is needed to reduce the time and cost of fabricating and testing the nanosats.  However, to achieve substantial savings, a fundamental paradigm shift in how spacecraft are built must be made.  Current spacecraft are built with the same processes and procedures used in the 1960?s, whereas electronics technology has gone far beyond that of the early days.  So while the size of satellites has steadily decreased, the manufacturing time has not experienced similar reductions.  Given that labor to build a satellite remains the single largest element of cost, the opportunity remains to dramatically shorten program schedules and lower cost through the infusion of new techniques and innovative processes in the construction of structures, electronics, harnessing and most importantly the testing process.  AeroAstro proposes to set aside the conventional rule book and explore a broad range of Design for Manufacture material and process innovations that could lead to a dramatic shortening of the micro/nano-satellite manufacturing timeline with concomitant savings in unit manufacturing cost.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","altitude                        atmosphere                        earth-science                        land-surface                        land-use-land-cover                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        topography","public",NA
"871","Enterprise Level Status and Control of Multi-Satellite Operations","Single-satellite mission operation centers are used for nearly all Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) mission ground data systems, with a focus on localized data distribution. However, as the strategic need to optimize the interoperability, interdependencies, and interrelationship of missions increases, the benefits of enterprise solutions and expanded information accessibility become more apparent. This proposal addresses that need by seeking to create the capacity for ground-based support for very high data rates and extremely large mission data volumes in a secure enterprise environment to allow mission data exchange and aggregation.The objective of this project is to take information from multiple operational environments and securely deliver it in a graphically useful manner to the end user. This flow of information must be tightly controlled and protected to prevent unintentional leaks of sensitive data prior to receipt by the user. Once the data reaches the user, it must be presented in a useful manner. A simple example of this sort of information would be log messages. A user cannot simply be sent all log messages; the originating system must have the ability to configure which messages will be made available and the end user must be able to filter critical alarm alert messages from mundane logs. The unique challenge of this project is not only its technical feasibility, but also the need to meet GSFC's network security requirements. The capability to move small amounts of data for a single mission with limited security has been demonstrated; however the problem of moving larger amounts of data quickly while keeping the process compliant with GSFC network security practices has not been solved. Work on this IRAD will be performed in collaboration with Goddard Communications and Security Services Division to ensure that all software is in compliance with these GSFC network security requirements. Once the data arrives at its destination it must be strategically presented to maximize its usefulness. There are, of course, many possible applications that can be conceived to meet mission operations needs, such as health and status displays of operational components. The scope of this work will include selecting and implementing a presentation of the data that will be of most benefit to end-users. Based on current knowledge of mission needs, this application will focus on presenting the status of mission operations hardware and software for one or multiple missions. This will allow both the monitoring of single missions and the consolidate aggregation of status information for the monitoring of large portions of the GSFC Satellite Fleet. The key deliverables for the first phase of this proposal are the software transport framework to move data from the operations center to the user,  the corresponding web-based application to display the targeted data, and instructions on how to enable and configure the integrated application to ensure compliance with GSFC network security requirements. The compliant framework and web application will be shown in a self-contained demonstration that illustrates the complete and secure flow of information. The resultant software application will also be compliant with the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) architecture.  GMSEC is a software-based architecture built on a publish/subscribe messaging framework, which addresses many long-standing issues associated with point-solution implementations of mission control center systems.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"872","The Station Manipulator Arm Augmented Reality Trainer, Phase I","One of the most demanding and high-stakes crew tasks aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is the capture of a visiting spacecraft by manual operation of the Space Station Robotic Manipulator System (SSRMS, or Canadarm2). The cost of a missed capture or improper arm/vehicle contact is likely to be very high. Since these operations may be performed up to six months after the most recent ground-based training, crews aboard the ISS prepare for such manual robotic tasks with the Robotics On-Board Trainer, a laptop-based graphical/dynamic simulator using NASA Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphic (DOUG) software from Johnson Space Center's Virtual Reality Laboratory. This system, however, does not utilize any real-world, 3-D, out-the-window views. Building upon recent advances in head-mounted augmented reality systems, the team of Systems Technology, Inc. and Dr. Stephen Robinson of UC Davis propose the Station Manipulator Arm Augmented Reality Trainer (SMAART) that will offer ISS crews significantly more realistic on-board refresher training for vehicle capture by manipulating the actual SSRMS with real out-the-Cupola-window views, but with a graphically-simulated vehicle overlaid on the astronaut's non-simulated view via a head-mounted display. Providing multi-sensory realism in on-board training for such high cognitive-demand skills is expected to increase crew readiness and therefore reduce operational risk for visiting vehicle capture.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","armstrong-flight-re...                        completed",NA,NA
"873","Future NAS Flight Demand Generation Tool, Phase II","Aviation and Air Traffic Management researchers are increasingly utilizing complex regional or NAS-wide simulations to evaluate future concepts.  These analyses require many thousands of flights (a flight schedule) that are each accurately defined for every stage of the flight (a flight plan).  Current methods of generating these huge input datasets are costly and time-intensive. The largely manual nature of the current process and lack of existing automation tools leaves great potential for significant errors in the data sets.  We propose to develop a powerful automated system for future demand generation. This tool will be able to input a variety of existing FAA and NASA flight data sets, provide the user with extensive options on defining the future demand data set, and output new flight data sets in formats compatible with major research simulation and analysis tools.  This capability will provide NASA and FAA research programs with significantly better analysis conclusions through the new ability to perform extensive sensitivity studies on new concepts to ensure they are robust to alternate potential future demand scenarios.  This is crucial to ensuring the decision to proceed with a multi-million dollar Decision Support Tool development is robust to alternate future demand possibilities.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

"880","Effect of Engine Installation on Jet Noise using a Hybrid LES/RANS Approach, Phase I","Installation effects arising from propulsion airframe interaction are known to produce substantial variations in the in-situ jet noise. A hybrid LES/RANS computational framework is proposed for prediction of noise from the engine and airframe, and interactions between airframe and propulsion systems. The basis of LES (large eddy simulation) is that the energy-bearing turbulent eddies in the dominant noise-generating region are directly captured in the simulation. Since LES must resolve the turbulent eddies it requires a grid which captures these motions; the number of grid points needed for LES is much larger than those for RANS and thus a brute-force LES of the entire noise producing region in a propulsion-airframe interaction problem is not feasible. However, the noise generation physics of these flows allows a logical assembly of a hybrid simulation tool where low-fidelity models (RANS) in one region of the flow are combined with turbulence-resolving models (LES) in other regions of the flow. Acoustic effects are another segment of propulsion-airframe interaction problem. Sound generated by various components of engine is altered by the presence of wing, fuselage, deployed flap etc. In the present proposal, alteration of sound due to the presence of airframe is added through application of Boundary Element Method (BEM) and an acoustic projection technique (FW-H surface method). To demonstrate the feasibility of using this framework, we focus on simulating flow configuration corresponding to a separate-flow nozzle of by pass ratio  5 with round fan and nozzle operating at the takeoff cycle point of with freestream Mach number of 0.28. Simulation results will be validated against experiments carried out in the Low Speed Aeroacoustics Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at NASA Langley's Jet Noise Laboratory (JNL). The high-fidelity model developed and validated in Phase I will be extended to explore more complex engine/airframe configurations in Phase II.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"887","Enabling multi-platform mission planning and operations simulation environments for adaptive remote sensors","We propose to develop a flexible and modular open source library for designing multi-platform missions with adaptive sensors operating under resource constraints in order to predict the science performance achieved and to refine adaptive methods in the design process. This work represents an important step in promoting the use of adaptive sensors in Earth observing missions.The growing potential of sensors capable of real-time adaptation of their operational parameters calls for a new class of mission planning and simulation tools. Existing simulation tools used in performing observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) assume a fixed set of sensor parameters in terms of observation geometry, frequencies used, resolution, or observation time, which allows simplifications to be made in the simulation process and allows sensor observation errors to be characterized a-priori. Adaptive sensors may vary all of these parameters depending on the scene observed, so that sensor performance is not simple to model without conducting OSSE simulations including sensor adaptation in response to stochastic variations in the scenes observed. The management of power and data volume resources on small satellite platforms as well as methods to allow collaborative sensing among sensors on multiple platforms are also high current needs for inclusion in mission simulation tools.The library will be developed based on the past experience of the project team with the development of OSSE and mission planning tools for multiple projects. These include the end-to-end-simulator developed for the eight satellite constellation of the CYGNSS program, a simulation tool and onboard processor developed to optimize mission operations for the CubeSat Radiometer Radio Frequency Interference Technology validation experiment, and past experience in the development of a fully  adaptive radar system and associated modeling and simulation environment. The library will progress from its current TRL 2 to a TRL 4 exit status through a two year project focused on library development and testing in year one and extensive demonstration through three case studies in year two.

"889","Adjustable Fidelity Computational Aeroelasticity Procedure (AFCAP), Phase I","NextGen proposes an approach to significantly enhance aeroelastic analysis capabilities over what is commonly available in linear analysis environments such as NASTANTM The approach to accomplish this builds upon an existing software framework that allows the integration of varying-fidelity aerodynamic modeling capability with varying videlit structural models. The approach utilizes inherently nonlinear aerodynamic predictions schemes that are incorporated into the aeroelastic solution strategy. Potentially large (geometrically nonlinear) structural deflections under the influence of nonlinear aerodynamic can be analyzed using the approach. Hierarchical levels of analysis capabilities are included, ranging from simple yet powerful empirical approaches to the complete coupling of high-order CFD codes and nonlinear structural models. An aeroservoelastic solution framework will be developed in Phase I resulting in a prototype nonlinear aeroelasticity method suitable for a proof-of-concept demonstration. The developed methods will be demonstrated on test cases of recent research interest, such as the Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) F/A-18 aircraft.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"899","VG2 URA PWS RAW EXPERIMENT WAVEFORM 60MS V1.0","This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver waveform receiver obtained during the Uranus encounter. The waveforms are collections of 4-bit samples of the electric field measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800 samples per second. 1600 samples are collected in 55.56 msec followed by a 4.44-msec gap. Each 60-msec interval constitutes a line of waveform samples. The data set includes about 271 frames of waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, each. The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as constructs in describing the form of the data. The waveform is sampled through a bandpass filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz. The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain control used in the waveform receiver. The instantaneous dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 db, but the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the instantaneous dynamic range. With the gain control, the overall dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 db. The automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data. However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained in most cases. The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the spacecraft. But the normal method of analyzing the waveform data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum. By stacking the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency- time spectrogram can be produced. Additional information about this dataset and the instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found in Gurnett et al. [1986] and a complete instrument description can be found in Scarf and Gurnett [1977].","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","comet-sl9-jupiter-c...                        uranus                        voyager","Earth Science",NA

"907","Study of Cosmic Ray H and He Isotopes","This proposal requests a support for analysis and interpretation of H and He isotope data from the last Antarctic balloon flight of the Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer (BESS-Polar II). The isotopes 2H and 3He in the cosmic radiation are mainly secondary products from the p-p and p-4He interactions of primary cosmic rays in the interstellar medium. Other reactions such as 4He - 4He and p-(Z > 3) contribute to a lesser extent to the production of 2H and 3He, as well as antiprotons. In the past most isotope measurements have been limited by statistics and mass resolution. BESS-Polar II flew for 24.5 days over Antarctica in 2007-2008. It recorded 4.7 billion events, about 5 times events collected with the prior BESS-Polar I. The BESS-Polar II data offer a unique opportunity to identify and precisely measure H and He isotopes over a wide rigidity range, ~ 0.5 GV to ~4 GV. The BESS instrument has many outstanding hardware features, which enable precise measurements of cosmic-ray H, He, and their isotopes, in addition to antiparticles. Its long-duration-balloon flight drastically reduced statistical uncertainties, and it provides the most precise measurements of H and He isotope fluxes and secondary-to-primary ratios. The unprecedented precision of BESS-Polar II measurements together with other cosmic-ray data, can strongly constrain propagation models and their parameters. It also facilitates a sensitive study of cosmic-ray time variations, which contribute to our understanding of local conditions in the Heliosphere as well as modeling of particle fluxes and plasma conditions in the near-Earth environment. The long duration of the BESS-Polar II flight and stability of its detectors enable the study of transient time variations of hydrogen and helium isotope fluxes. Measurements of 2H and 3He isotopes along with their main parents 1H and 4He provide important information on both the Galactic and heliospheric propagation of cosmic rays, as well as a 'tracer' for antiproton calculations. Current propagation models will be evaluated using already reported antiproton/proton ratios together with the new 2H/1H and 3He/4He ratios. The proposed activities address NASA's 2010 Science Plan for SMD's Science Goals in Astrophysics and Heliophysics, specifically with the objectives to 'Understand the origin and destiny of the universe, and the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter, and gravity' and to 'Understand the fundamental physical processes of the space environment from the Sun to Earth, to other planets, and beyond to the interstellar medium'.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"908","Low Power Digital Correlator System for PATH Mission, Phase II","The NASA's PATH mission employs GeoSTAR spectral radiometer processing data from antenna consisting of three arms, each holding 128 microwave receivers. Each of the 384 receivers amplifies RF signals, and down-converts them to an intermediate frequency (IF). As a result, 768 in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are produced with a frequency of 10 to 500MHz. The IF signals have to be normalized and digitized with 1Gs/s sampling rate for further cross-correlation. Each signal from one arm of the receiver must be cross-correlated with all signals from the other two arms, therefore a system containing 196,000 parallel cross-correlation blocks is needed. Since the GeoSTAR is a space born instrument, low power dissipation and ensuring system reliability, through processing redundancy, are one of the most important requirements. A system assembled by using off-the-shelf components would be extremely power inefficient, bulky, and unreliable. Therefore, a system that is based on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is required. While working on the NASA's SBIR Phase II project ""Low Power Cross-Correlator ASIC"" (NNX13CP01C), Pacific Microchip Corp. has developed and fabricated  an ASIC that includes 128-element array of 2-bit 1GS/s ADCs, and 4096 parallel cross-correlation cells. The ASIC was designed based on the GeoSTAR radiometer requirements, therefore it is intended to be the key component in the cross-correlator system which is being developed. The system will contain means correlation results further post-processing and control of ASICs.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA
"909","Solving a prisoner's dilemma in distributed anomaly detection","Anomaly detection has recently become an important problem in many industrial and financial applications. In several instances, the data to be analyzed for possible anomalies is located at multiple sites and cannot be merged due to practical constraints such as bandwidth limitations and proprietary concerns. At the same time, the size of data sets affects prediction quality in almost all data mining applications. In such circumstances, distributed data mining algorithms may be used to extract information from multiple data sites in order to make better predictions. In the absence of theoretical guarantees, however, the degree to which data decentralization affects the performance of these algorithms is not known, which reduces the data providing participants' incentive to cooperate.This creates a metaphorical 'prisoners' dilemma' in the context of data mining.In this work, we propose a novel general framework for distributed anomaly detection with theoretical performance guarantees. Our algorithmic approach combines existing anomaly detection procedures with a novel method for computing global statistics using local sufficient statistics. We show that the performance of such a distributed approach is indistinguishable from that of a centralized instantiation of the same anomaly detection algorithm, a condition that we call zero information loss. We further report experimental results on synthetic as well as real-world data to demonstrate the viability of our approach.The remaining content of this presentation is presented in Fig. 1.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.This data set, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree daily, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014.The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006).

"934","NEMS Oscillators as Sensors and Actuators: Understanding the Mechanical Properties of Nanoresonators and Their Applications for Molecular Sensing","Development of nanotechnology and enhancement of nanostructures for future applications requires a good understanding of a material's behavior at the nanoscale, as it differs from that at the bulk size. Specially designed In-Situ Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) holders for this task [i.e. Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)-TEM and TEM-Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)] allow a materials' behavior and responses to applied mechanical stress and electric fields to be studied. These In Situ STM-TEM and TEM-AFM techniques can be used to address questions regarding the electrical and mechanical stability and capability of materials with high resolution. To our specific interest, we would like to study the mechanical behavior of Nanoelectromechanical Systems (NEMS) oscillators for sensors and actuators applications. The proposed work will study two materials for NEMS oscillators: Silica Nanorods and amorphous-Carbon (a-C) multi branched nanostructures (Nanotrees).The following goals will work includes: To grow fractal multibranched carbon nanostructures and silica nanorods by novel e-beam irradiation techniques developed in our laboratory, To conduct TEM-AFM measurements to obtain their mechanical properties. Deformation forces versus displacement will be measured to directly obtain Young's modulus, Stress, Strain, and Bending Modulus, among others. Mechanical response of Silica Nanorods will be monitored at different e-beam doses. Mechanical properties for a-C Nanotrees are expected to be studied at NASA Langley Research Center, under the supervision of Jae-Woo Kim, during the summer of 2011. To use the STM-TEM holder and a radiofrequency source to find the resonance frequencies. For this, two approaches will be used: first, to use a piezoelectric microdevice specially designed for these experiments, and second, to use polarization of an STM tip. Silica Nanorods and a-C Nanotrees will be grown In Situ at the tip of a porous silicon film inside the TEM. Resonance (or near-resonance) frequencies will be determined, in both approaches, by direct monitoring of the nanostructure's oscillation response. Experimental resonance frequencies and Q factors will be obtained. Mechanical properties, such as bending modulus and Young's modulus, will be determined from the structures' resonance frequencies, indirectly. To conduct graphitization studies of a-C Nanotrees, by applying a current on the nanotree's branches and thus heating it. This heating is predicted to cause some reorganization of the atomic structure, thus changing the a-C into graphite. Mechanical and electrical properties will be measured for the a-C/Graphite Nanotrees. Our expected outcomes are to combine novel growth techniques and direct in-situ TEM measurements to understand the electrical and mechanical properties of silica nanorods and fractal carbon nanostructures for the development of novel ultrasensitive nanoresonator detectors. In particular: the use of novel growth method for silica nanorods will allow us to tailor its dimension and final shape with nanoscale accuracy to tune resonance frequencies and form silica-based multi-frequency nanoresonator detectors, exploit the fractal structure of multibranched carbon nanofibers to minimize steric effects and develop highly sensitive bio- and chemical sensors. These ultrasensitive resonators can serve as sub-microgram sensors by observing the structure's resonance frequencies. Also, TEM-AFM measurements will provide understanding about the mechanical response of materials at the nanoscale that could guide new developments in nanosensors and actuators technology.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed",NA,NA

Our innovative design for the preconcentrator combines high water sampling flow rates with low dead volume, thus enhancing preconcentration. This is designed to meet monitoring needs for NASA's Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs) and addresses a key technology gap for long-duration human spaceflight, since standard techniques will not function without gravitation to stabilize phase boundaries. Human exploration of the solar system will depend on such technology, since water must be recycled and the option of returning grab samples to Earth for analysis from beyond low-Earth orbits does not exist.During Phase II, we plan to incorporate this technology into a miniaturized water preconcentrator module.

"943","Development of Grating Technology for High-Resolution Spectrometers Using Nanofabrication Techniques","Several of astronomy's key future science objectives as identified by NASA can be achieved with soft X-ray spectroscopy. This study seeks to develop a new technique for fabricating X-ray reflection gratings to be integrated in future X-ray spectrometer designs. The fabrication method developed in this study will create a reflection grating with a true radial profile, which is a requirement in order to eliminate grating-induced aberrations to the telescope focus and achieve the required resolving power of future missions. If successful, the technology developed in this study will lead to the realization of theoretical X-ray spectrometer performance on timescales consistent with the next decadal survey.This study will build on our research group's strong heritage in the development of X-ray reflection gratings and introduce a new fabrication technique that retains current state-of-the-art grating efficiency while also achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in resolving power.The new fabrication technique is centered around piezoelectric materials and will be approached as follows: first, I will model grating applications of piezoelectric materials and conduct trade-study to determine most suitable piezoelectric materials to be used in grating fabrication. I will then obtain materials and begin implementation of the planned fabrication procedures: create a ""master"" grating with parallel grooves current electron-beam lithography (EBL) employed in our grating fabrication efforts in order to retain the precise groove facets achievable with EBL; the EBL ""master"" will then be imprinted into a soft resist that is coated upon a wafer of piezoelectric material, beneath which are electrodes to control the current through the material; with the parallel-groove profile imprinted into the resist, a variable current will be applied across the piezoelectric material to force the resist to conform to a pre-selected pattern, which will transform the parallel grooves into a radial profile without sacrificing the precise facets introduced in the original EBL write; the pattern will then be UV-cured in order to solidify the resist and lock the radial profile into place; finally, this new piezoelectric master will be used to imprint dozens of replicas.The entire process will certainly require a significant amount of development and trial-and-error, which includes testing intermediate prototypes at NASA centers for both efficiency and resolution. However, if implemented successfully, this technology will make possible both the order-of-magnitude gains in effective area and resolving power over current observatories that is required for future X-ray missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        pennsylvania-state-...",NA,NA

The Lidar Level 2 Cloud Profile data product contains cloud profile data and ancillary data. The cloud profile product is produced at 5 km horizontal resolution and is written in HDF. Note that there is no atmospheric volume characterization associated with the cloud profile products. Also, the 1064 calibration scheme assumes that both the extinction and the backscatter from clouds are spectrally independent. Consistent with this assumption, extinction and backscatter profiles will be reported for clouds only at 532 nm. Additionally, it is important to note that the aerosol profile product extends upward to 30.1 km, while the cloud profile product ceases at 20.2. Therefore, users interested in polar stratospheric clouds will need to order the aerosol profile data product. The science algorithms used to produce the V3.30 CALIOP data products are identical to those used to generate the V3.01 and V3.02 products; however, some of the ancillary data used in the V3.30 analyses is different. All CALIOP data products rely on meteorological data provided by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). The V3.01 and V3.02 data products were produced using the GMAO's GEOS 5.2 data products. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) was launched on April 28, 2006 to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations.

"949","Land Surface Model (LSM 1.0) for Ecological, Hydrological, Atmospheric Studies","The NCAR LSM 1.0 is a land surface model developed to examine biogeophysical and biogeochemical land-atmosphere interactions, especially the effects of land surfaces on climate and atmospheric chemistry. It can be run coupled to an atmospheric model or uncoupled, in a stand-alone mode, if an atmospheric forcing is provided. The model runs on a spatial grid that can range from one point to global. The model was designed for coupling to atmospheric numerical models. Consequently, there is a compromise between computational efficiency and the complexity with which the necessary atmospheric, ecological, and hydrologic processes are parameterized. The model is not meant to be a detailed micrometeorological model, but rather a simplified treatment of surface fluxes that reproduces at minimal computational cost the essential characteristics of land-atmosphere interactions important for climate simulations. The model is a complete executable code with its own time-stepping driver, initialization (subroutine lsmini), and main calling routine (subroutine lsmdrv). When coupled to an atmospheric model, the atmospheric model is the time-stepping driver. There is one call to subroutine lsmini during initialization to initialize all land points in the domain; there is one call per time step to subroutine lsmdrv to calculate surface fluxes and update the ecological, hydrological, and thermal state for all land points in the domain. The model writes its own restart and history files. These can be turned off if appropriate. Available for downloading from the ORNL DAAC are the LMS Model Documentation and User's Guide, the model source code, input data set, and scripts for running the model.  Applications of the model are described in two additional companion files.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        atmospheric-radiation                        biosphere                        earth-science                        ecological-dynamics                        land-surface                        soils                        surface-radiative-p...                        surface-thermal-pro...                        vegetation","public",NA

"951","CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster for LEO and Deep Space Missions, Phase I","Aether Industries proposes the development of a novel, primary plasma propulsion system that is well suited for small spacecraft. This technology, called the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (CAT), would provide CubeSats and other micro- and nano-satellites with the propulsive capability to make meaningful orbital plane and altitude changes  capability that does not currently exist with state-of-the-art micropropulsion technologies. As such, the CAT engine is an enabling technology that supports NASA, commercial, university, and military CubeSat needs from constellation deployment to lunar orbit insertion and beyond. In the CAT engine, a high-power  RF plasma discharge is expanded adiabatically along a magnetic nozzle topology established by permanent magnets. A resultant ambipolar electric field accelerates the ions to high energies to generate thrust while retaining high propellant utilization. The CAT engine offers a means of providing efficient and high thrust-to-power primary propulsion for CubeSats and microsatellites. The CAT engine promises to change the CubeSat paradigm from passive sensor carriers to fully capable mission-completing spacecraft. Successful implementation by our team will result in the transition of technology developed  into the commercial sector by a small business, the engagement of the next generation of the space sector workforce, and the infusion of an advanced in-space propulsion technology for future NASA, commercial, and government missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

Whatever the task, robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts and possibly Mission Control. There is a need for cooperation and communication among all autonomous entities. Robotic intelligence is required in at least four areas: two-way communication with humans, safety awareness, self-monitoring, and self-maintenance. Robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts concerning the state of their hardware. They may need to interact with humans in order to insure human safety.  In Phase 1, we developed an initial HSI Framework (HSIF) to structure protocol-driven interactions (conversations) among Astronauts and multiple-component autonomous systems (soft-bot systems (SBS)). In Phase 2, we extend our HSI framework, with new protocol development that will support interactions among {human-robot team}, {SBS- robot}, {human- robot} and {SBS- human -- robot team}.

"956","Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS) Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications - 3 (OSTA3) Carbon Monoxide 5 degree by 5 degree data","MAPS Overview The MAPS experiment measures the global distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios in the free troposphere. Because of MAPS' previous flights on board the Space Shuttle, Earth system scientists now know that carbon monoxide concentrations in the troposphere are highly variable around the planet, and that widespread burning in the South American Amazon Basin and southern cerrados, the African savannahs,and the Australian grasslands and ranches are major sources of carbon monoxide in the southern hemisphere and tropical troposphere.InstrumentThe MAPS instrument is based on a technique called gas filter radiometry. Thermal energy from the Earth passes through the atmosphere and enters the viewport of the downlooking MAPS instrument. Carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere produce unique absorption lines in the transmitted energy. The energy which enters the MAPS instrument is split into & three beams. One beam passes through a cell containing CO and falls onto a detector. This CO gas cell acts as a filter for the effects of CO present in the middle troposphere. A second beam falls directly onto a detector without passing through any gas filter. The difference in the voltage of the signals from these two detectors can be used to determine the amount of CO present in the atmosphere at an altitude of 7-8 km. A third beam of the incident energy passes through a cell containing N2O and falls onto a detector. This N2O gas cell acts as a filter for the effects of N2O present in the atmosphere. The global distribution of N2O is well known, so the N2O signal can be used to detect the presence of clouds in the field of view and to correct the simultaneous CO measurement for systematic errors in the data. The data that are available from MAPS OSTA3 include a 5 by 5 degree gridded box (MAPS_OSTA3_5X5_HDF) and a second by second data product (MAPS_OSTA3_COSEC_HDF).

Two different bonding approaches and membrane configurations will be used for the first approach.

This way, our melting technique in producing the best possible finish on the lens surface SLM can provide.

"965","Solar Cycle Studies for the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat Missions","OBJECTIVES. The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) program is a successful science CubeSat mission for the H-TIDeS LCAS program, and we propose to extend the MinXSS studies with a second launch in December 2016 with improved instrumentation for a new 4-year mission. The original MinXSS-1 mission objectives are to better understand the energy distribution of solar flare soft X-ray (SXR) emissions and its impact on Earth’s ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere (ITM). These studies, currently funded through 2016, focus on the solar SXR variability of active region evolution and flares during the MinXSS-1 six-month mission, modeling of the solar SXR variability, and understanding how the solar SXR energizes Earth’s ionospheric E-region (80-150 km). The MinXSS-2 mission with its longer 4-year life will extend these studies during the declining phase of solar cycle 24, cycle minimum, and the rising phase of solar cycle 25. MinXSS will enhance these original studies during these different solar cycle phases by characterizing the differences in (1) the active region heating / abundance, (2) flare energetics, and (3) solar forcing in Earth’s upper atmosphere. METHODOLOGY. MinXSS is a solar-oriented, 3-axis-controlled, 3-unit CubeSat to observe the solar SXR spectrum between 0.6 and 30 keV (0.04 and 2 nm). The X-ray spectrometer on MinXSS has a nominal spectral resolution of 0.15 keV full width half maximum (FWHM). The capabilities of this X-ray spectrometer have been flight-proven on MinXSS-1 and also previously on sounding rocket flights in 2012 and 2013. An improved version of this X-ray spectrometer is on MinXSS-2. The other major technology on MinXSS is the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) from Blue Canyon Technologies (BCT); the BCT 0.5-unit ADCS has been flight proven on MinXSS-1 with precision solar pointing to ~10 arc-seconds. The MinXSS-1 was launched in December 2015 to the International Space Station (ISS) and deployed from the ISS on May 16, 2016. Starting from the ISS altitude of ~400 km, the MinXSS-1 mission life is only about 6 months. The MinXSS-2 spacecraft was built in parallel with MinXSS-1 and is being delivered to Spaceflight Industries in fall 2016 for its launch into a 500-km sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). This free ride-of-opportunity for MinXSS-2 from Google Terra Bella (formerly Skybox Imaging) was not planned in the original MinXSS program that only provides support for development of the MinXSS spacecraft and the MinXSS-1 mission through 2016. This proposal supports the new MinXSS-2 mission for two years (2017-2018) and an extended mission for two more years (or opportunity to be extended in the next Senior Review in 2017). As with MinXSS-1, closure on the science objectives involves comparisons with SDO and RHESSI measurements, ITM modeling using the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM), and improvements to the empirical Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM) that is used for a variety of space weather research applications. New for MinXSS-2 is the addition of comparative studies with Hinode and NuSTAR solar measurements, studies correlating the measured photospheric magnetic field flux to soft X-ray spectra, and physics-based modeling of the SXR spectra. We have added two more Co-Is for supporting the extra research, and we are also adding a second ground station at Geophysical Institute (GI) in Alaska for increasing the daily data downlink by a factor of six over MinXSS-1. We are willing to share LASP and GI ground stations with another NASA CubeSat.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

"967","Large Optical Telescope Based on High Efficiency Thin Film Planar Diffractive Optics, Phase I","In future ground-based receivers for deep-space optical communications with spacecraft, aperture diameters of the order of 10 meters are required even with the most sensitive available detectors. Directly applying the technology of 10 meter class ground-based telescopes is cost prohibitive. Also, conventional astronomical telescopes are not compatible with operation within 5 degees of the sun, but such near-sun operation is required with the Ground-based Telescope Assembly to provide consistent and reliable wideband communications with interplanetary spacecraft. BEAM Co. proposes to develop a telescope based on diffractive optics that is expected to be far less expensive to manufacture than a telescope based on conventional reflective optics. Our approach takes advantage of the well-defined wavelength of the optical communications beam, thus allowing a high-efficiency design that is expected to be much lighter than a conventional design, thereby reducing the cost of the system that will be used to point the telescope. At the end of Phase I, we will have fabricated and tested subscale diffractive optical elements and performed tests to validate the technology's scalability to large apertures and its capability to support the <20 microradian object space spot size requirement as well as the requirement for near-sun operation.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA
"968","Design and Simulation Tools for Planetary Atmospheric Entry Vehicles, Phase I","Atmospheric entry is one of the most critical phases of flight during planetary exploration missions. During the design of an entry vehicle, experimental and analytical methods are used; however, the current integration level of experimental and analytical methods with planetary entry simulations is low.  Comprehensive software, comprised of multiple design tool components for simulating planetary entry, analyzing experimental data, and evaluating configuration modifications and control designs, will be developed.  The software will be configured so that it can accommodate vehicles ranging from blunt bodies to aircraft-like configurations.  Furthermore, the software will be designed as an extension of current aircraft flight dynamics theory so that aerospace engineers with basic flight dynamics knowledge will have an easy transition to entry body flight dynamics.  Merging of the aircraft and entry vehicle flight dynamics enables educational institutions to adopt entry vehicle flight dynamics as an extension to current aircraft flight dynamics educational programs. This will promote the education of the next generation of engineers with the basic knowledge of entry flight dynamics. The proposed software will run on a desktop / laptop computer so that proof-of-concept design work can be done easily, efficiently, and at low cost.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

"973","Centrifugal Sieve for Size-Segregation/ Beneficiation of Regolith, Phase I","Utilizing centrifugal force as the primary body-force, combined with both shearing flow and vibratory motion the proposed centrifugal-sieve separators can provide efficient gravity-level-independent size classification of granular feedstock like lunar regolith.  Standard size separation methods for dry materials often depend on gravity as the primary body force. For separation of small sizes, gravity-force is usually supplemented with vibration and shearing flow. Granular materials naturally stratify during shear-flow with larger particles rising to the top. Depending on frequency and intensity, vibrations alone can induce large particles to rise to the top in a granular bed, independent of shear flow.  The proposed centrifugal size-separators utilize the natural size stratification of flowing granular solids. They will function equally well under reduced gravity conditions and in vacuum. The nominal design is a configuration with only one moving part and no blades, or other high-wear components. Shearing flow and vibrations combined with a size-separating screen at the outside (or 'bottom') of the flow will separate particles, with the fines passing through the outer wall screen, and the coarse material passing axially through the continuous feed system. Multiple size separation streams are possible. Alternate designs with shear-enhancing blades, 'above' or inside the screen, will also be evaluated. Various approaches for screen deblinding, and other robustness enhancements, are part of the proposed designs. With appropriate selection of passing-screen size, and deblinding enhancements, the centrifugal-sieves could be used for regolith processor feedstock conditioning to remove material > 0.5cm diameter, and with alternate settings and screen size, also used for a degree of beneficiation, to select particular size ranges that have the highest percentage of desired mineral content.  The centrifugal-sieve concept can be scaled to any desired mass flow rate.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

The development of an innovative Wireless Integrated Microelectronic Vacuum Sensor System for monitoring vacuum-jacketed pipelines is proposed that would address the need of NASA for measurements of the insulating capability of cryogenic lines for ground testing, flight vehicles, and launch facilities.  Recent advances in both MEMS vacuum gauge technology and low-power, long range radio frequency transceivers has enabled the development of a low-cost, miniature device with sophisticated capabilities.  The complete, self-contained, battery operated system would fit within the volume of the current vacuum gauges only and provide periodic, continuous monitoring of vacuum conditions throughout the entire facility.  Such a system would reduce operations costs and increase vacuum jacket reliability by eliminating the need for human intervention, reduce package, wiring size and weight, and provide constant network reporting and monitoring of the facility from any Internet enabled computer.  Beyond this application for vacuum monitoring, the long-range wireless sensor networking capabilities developed under this program would be applicable to a vast array of other sensor types and control applications throughout Stennis Space Center and other NASA facilities.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        stennis-space-center",NA,NA

The concept is innovative because it safely eliminates handling of hydrogen, and works irrespective of gravity and pressure environments with no moving parts and no multi-phase flows.  The innovation is efficient because it requires no expendables while being compact with minimal impact on mass.  The innovation is practical because it evolves from the well-established, current state of the art in oxygen production for the regenerative air revitalization system slated for the International Space Station.  The approach proposed addresses the crux of the innovation in Phase I through modeling and experimentation to immediately identify the most feasible approach to its implementation.  Phase II will encompass more detailed experimentation to optimize the subsystem design resulting in a fully functioning regenerative oxygen subsystem for advanced life support.  The consequence is significant because solid oxide electrolysis is an inherently suitable technology (and possibly the only technology) for enabling 100% oxygen regeneration from carbon dioxide and water vapor, two byproducts of crew activity that must be managed regardless.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA

Such a mission will advance our understanding of the Solar System, exoplanetary systems, planetary formation and evolution. The IGPDS report identified twelve science objectives for ice giant exploration that are consistent with the Vision and Voyages Planetary Science Decadal Survey (NRC 2011). Highlighted in the report are two science objectives, of equal importance, that relate to the atmospheric (thermal) structure of these icy worlds: (i) determine the planet's atmospheric heat balance, and (ii) determine the planet's tropospheric 3-D flow. Key questions concerning the atmospheric structure arise: What are the altitudes/pressures and compositions of the cloud layers? How do the cloud layers interact with solar visible and planetary thermal radiation to influence the atmospheric energy balance? How does the energy balance contribute to atmospheric dynamics? Our unique Net Flux Radiometer (NFR) concept, onboard a probe descending deep into the atmosphere will contribute greatly to answering these questions by measuring the upward and downward radiation flux, in seven spectral channels, each with a 5-degree Field-Of-View (FOV) and in five sequential view (sky) angles as a function of altitude/pressure. We will develop a prototype advanced Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) housed in a vacuum micro-vessel, a key sub-system of our NFR. The design, build and validation of this sub-system will mature this technology from TRL-2 to TRL-4. We propose to develop an advanced NFR FPA, comprising integrated detector and Winston cone sub-assemblies, housed inside a vacuum micro-vessel. The vacuum micro-vessel is required to help mitigate the effects of rapid changes in temperature of the FPA that the instrument will experience during a probe descent into either a Uranus or a Neptune atmosphere. The FPA will be integrated with a fold mirror sub-assembly and assembled into a vacuum micro-vessel to mature this technology from TRL-2 to TRL-4.

These PGWs leave a signature on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) called the primordial ""B-modes."" The quest for detection of this signature has launched substantial technological development because this signal is predicted to be one part in a billion of the unpolarized signal.The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a ground based telescope array which will measure the polarization of the CMB to unprecedented accuracy. This measurement will require the development of several technologies which will be required for the possible space mission outlined in the Epoch of Inflation Technology push. CLASS will be an important test-bed for these technologies and will raise the technology readiness level of several relevant instruments.CLASS will use extremely sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator to make a multifrequency measurement of the polarized CMB on the largest angular scales. By searching for the predicted peak in the primordial B-mode power spectrum, CLASS will detect the PGW signature if the tensor to scalar ratio is greater than 0.01.A detection of primordial gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation would have transformative effects on the field of cosmology.

The innovation is the development of interpenetrating polymer networks for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on NASA missions.  The anticipated result is a combination of high-performance aromatic polymers with hydrogen-rich aliphatic polymers to create composite materials that combine the structural properties of the high-performance polymers with increased shielding effectiveness of the hydrogen-rich polymers.  The proposed materials have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, and structural integrity to permit use in flexible and rigid structures and habitats.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

The cross-track scanner uses a whiskbroom pattern with three simultaneous  scans and independent receiver FOV's which provides 30,000 points per sweep. Solar background is reduced with a narrow bandpass filter and a narrow transmitter linewidth with center wavelength control.

"994","Fast Fiber-Coupled Imaging of X-rays Events, Phase I","HyperV Technologies Corp. proposes to construct a long-record-length, fiber-coupled, fast imaging diagnostic for recording X-ray back-lit material flows and X-ray emission events. X-ray imaging of material flows in detonation fronts and combustion through protective housings has many important aerospace, industrial and defense implications. First HyperV will design, construct and test, in conjunction with UAH, a single fiber coupled X-ray scintillator pixel. Silicon Photo-multipliers will be investigated to maximize channel properties for the accepted cost and desired scalability. Next we will develope an X-ray imager of at least 16 pixels for observing X-ray backlit material flows based off of the single channel experiments. A camera performance of at least 2500 frames at 10 Megaframes per second with at least 12-16 bits per pixel will be targeted. X-ray emission from backlighter will be shone through a rocket motor and projected onto a scintillator. The optical emission from the scintillator is then observed by a fiber imaging grid. The imaging grid would then couple light to a bank of amplified SiPM pixels with integrated analog gain and data acquisition.  HyperV has already demonstrated as part of previous work a two clock domain technique for using slow cheap micro-controllers to manage high time resolution data acquisition over long record-length with a low cost digital backend. HyperV has also demonstrated that this back end can be used to observe SiPM as well as photodiode detectors.  We propose now to extend these techniques observe X-ray induced emission of scintillator materials for performing time resolved imaging of X-rays. This small scale imager would then be used to observe material flows in rocket motors in the UAH X-ray laboratory as a demonstration of the diagnostics capability.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        stennis-space-center",NA,NA
"995","Novel Solid State Lasers for Space-Based Water Vapor DIAL, Phase II","This Phase II program will develop novel laser transmitters needed for planned airborne and space-based active remote sensing missions. This program will build on successful Phase I work to provide a Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) laboratory brassboard demonstrator of a new laser source for Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) measurements of atmospheric water vapor with secondary capability for methane characterization as well. Accurate measurements of both atmospheric constituents are critical to the understanding of global energy transport and climate change. Under our Phase I program, Fibertek successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads. In Phase II we propose to build on our successful Phase I demonstration to develop a full scale water vapor laser transmitter source, meeting or exceeding requirements for planned DIAL instruments.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA
"996","A Software Tool for Improved Noise Source Identification and Understanding, Phase I","Innovative Technology Applications Company and Drs. P. Morris and K. Brentner will make improvements in noise prediction and measurement methods for subsonic and supersonic vehicles. Possible areas of application for the finished product include aerodynamic noise from fans, jets, turbomachinery, engine cores, propfans, propellers, and airframe components.  The proposed Phase I work will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of a tool which will enable the NASA customer to gain deeper insight into aerodynamic noise sources and develop improved methods for experimentally detecting them. Ultimately, this will enable improved source identification techniques and greater understanding of the physics associated with the data obtained from experimental phased array microphone arrays.  The approach taken by the proposed work to accomplish these goals is to use an unsteady simulation of nearfield unsteady flow to feed a Ffowcs Williams-Hawking solver. The acoustic field is then propagated to a numerical phased array of microphones and the data recorded just as it would in a wind tunnel or flyover experiment. The data is then processed according to the state-of-the-art data reduction methods and the resulting predictions of noise sources compared to the detailed data from the unsteady simulation to gainadditional insight.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA
"997","New Analysis and Theory of Deployable Folded Structures, Phase I","A recently developed mathematical theory has great value for deployable space structures and in situ manufacture of large beams, panels, cylinders and other components.  The new technology offers diverse capacity to design, manufacture, and self-assemble periodically folded sheet material.  The range of materials includes many customized core materials for laminated panels, cellular habitat wall constructions, structural beams, parabolic reflectors, and efficient truss systems that can be packaged ideally as a roll of sheet material and deployed in space by inflation or passive radiation.  The goal of this proposal is to launch the technology by demonstrating the diversity of folding architectures for deployable and in situ manufacture of space structures, and by developing the design and simulation software for distribution to the engineering community.To fully illustrate the scope of applying the design methodology for deployable space structures, inventories of the strategy for deployment, the desired laminate geometry, and the folding architectures will be made. By relating the dynamical constraints of these three inventories in a three-axis matrix and then optimizing the found solutions through the software, a diverse scope of deployable structures will be illustrated.  Moreover, proof of concept for a second generation of software operating through new algorithms will be  shown concurrently for space applications and others.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

So the fundamental elements of a rover for Venus are not beyond the bounds of physics: we could survive the furnace of Venus-- if we can build a low-power mobility system like a landsail.The surface of Venus is the most hostile environment in the solar system, with a surface temperature hotter than an oven, and a high-pressure, corrosive atmosphere. It is significant that, although humans have sent rovers to Mars with operating lifetimes of eight years and counting, the most capable mission to the surface of Venus has been a stationary lander that survived for only two hours. Exploring the surface of Venus with a rover would be a ""stretch"" goal, which will push the limits of technology in high-temperature electronics, robotics, and robust systems.   In work to develop sensors to work inside of jet engines, NASA Glenn has developed electronics that will continue to function even at the Venus temperature of 450°C. These electronic components represent a breakthrough in technological capability for high temperatures. We have also tested solar cells up to Venus surface temperatures; although the power density produced is low (because of the high cloud levels and thick atmosphere), we can produce electrical power on the surface.

"1000","High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulant, Phase I","The severity of the lunar dust problems encountered during the Apollo missions were consistently underestimated by ground tests, illustrating the need to develop significantly better lunar dust simulants and simulation facilities. ORBITEC proposes to develop a family of High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants that will better match the unique properties of lunar dust than existing simulants (such as JSC-1AF). Current lunar dust simulants do not have enough of the very fine particles, and they lack the agglutinitic glass and complex surface textures that dominate lunar dust. The proposed family of High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants will approximate the size, morphology, composition, and other important properties of lunar dust. High-Fidelity Lunar Dust Simulants are required to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems and to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies. The proposed Phase 1 effort will define requirements, develop, characterize, and deliver a sample of a prototype lunar dust simulant to NASA (TRL 4).

This data set distributes, for each of 66 map zones, a set of six raster files in GeoTIFF format. There is a detailed README companion file for each map zone. There is also an ArcGIS shapefile (mapping_zone_shapefile.shp) with the boundaries of all the map zones. A mosaic image of biomass at 240 m resolution for the whole conterminous U.S. is also included.Please read this important note regarding the differences of Version 2 from Version 1 of the NBCD 2000 data. With Version 1, in some mapping zones, certain land cover types (in particular Shrubs, NLCD Type 52) were missing from and unaccounted for in modeled estimates because of a lack of reference data. In Version 1, when landcover types were missing in the models, the model for the deciduous tree cover type was applied. While more woody vegetation was mapped, the authors think this had little effect on model performance as in most cases NLCD version 1 cover type was not a strong predictor of modeled estimates (See companion Mapping Zone Readme files). In Version 2, after renewed modeling efforts and user feedback, these previously unaccounted for cover types are now included in modeled estimates.All 66 mapping zones were updated with the previously unmapped land cover types now mapped. The authors recommend use of the new version for all analyses and will only support the updated version.Development of the data set used an empirical modeling approach that combined USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data with high-resolution InSAR data acquired from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and optical remote sensing data acquired from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. Three-season Landsat ETM+ data were systematically compiled by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) between 1999 and 2002 for the entire U.S. and were the foundation for development of both the USGS National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001) and the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE). Products from both the NLCD 2001 (landcover and canopy density) and LANDFIRE (existing vegetation type) projects as well as topographic information from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) were used within the NBCD 2000 project as spatial predictor layers for canopy height and biomass estimation. Forest survey data provided by the USDA Forest Service FIA program were made available to the project under a national Memorandum of Understanding. The response variables (canopy height and biomass) used in model development and validation were derived from the FIA database (FIADB). Production of the NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE projects was based on a mapping zone approach in which the conterminous U.S. was split into 66 ecoregionally distinct mapping zones. This mapping zone approach was also adopted by the NBCD 2000 project.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","biosphere                        earth-science                        vegetation","public",NA

SSVDTMs merge solid state semiconductor technology, including process fabrication techniques, with vacuum electronics, and, in this case, specifically thermionic vacuum electronics. SSVDTMs have already been demonstrated for highly demanding high frequency applications. Thermionic SSVDTMs, in which vacuum transport is by thermionically emitted electrons, are especially promising due to their intrinsic internal high temperature operation and radiation hardness.  SSVDTMs are extremely well suited for extreme environments that, for example, exist on or near Venus.  InnoSys proposed and successfully demonstrated in Phase I of this SBIR project SSVDTM triodes/field effect transistors and the associated assembly and sealing to meet the requirements needed for extreme high temperature electronics.  In particular, SSVDTM electronics were successfully experimentally demonstrated fully operational at 500C. In addition, radiation insensitive SSVDTM electronics were also successfully experimentally demonstrated during Phase I of this SBIR project.

"1012","A Compact, High-Precision Optical Payload Enabling Earth-Sized Exoplanet Detection Using Nanosatellites","The objective of the proposed research program is to design, build, test, and fly a compact, high-precision optical payload that is compatible with nanosatellite platforms. Nanosatellites (i.e. spacecraft weighing less than approximately 10 kg) hold the promise of low-cost access to space and more rapid development. On the other hand, nanosatellites impose severe mass, volume, and power constraints that make cutting-edge science difficult without additional technology development. Such a technology development is the subject of this proposal, encompassing optical design, integrated simulation, and model-based systems engineering. The proposed payload would fly as part of ExoplanetSat, a 3U CubeSat space telescope designed to detect transiting Earth-size exoplanets bright, Sun-like stars. Specific activities to be performed as part of this program are the development of a composite focal plane array combining CMOS and CCD imaging sensors for guide star tracking and science measurements, respectively; optimizing the sensor for high performance in the absence of active thermal control; developing a custom lens to serve as the optical telescope element; and creating a new tool that facilitates model-based systems engineering (MBSE) for small satellites. This work is significant to NASA in that the proposed technology development will allow low-cost platforms (e.g. CubeSats) to conduct meaningful science within their strict size, mass, and power constraints.

"1015","Developing fine-pixel CdTe detectors for the next generation of high-resolution hard x-ray telescopes","Over the past decade, the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been improving the angular resolution of hard X-ray (HXR; ~20–70 keV) optics to the point that we now routinely manufacture optics modules with an angular resolution of 20 arcsec Half Power Diameter (HDP), almost three times the performance of NuSTAR optics (Ramsey et al. 2013; Gubarev et al. 2013a; Atkins et al. 2013). New techniques are currently being developed to provide even higher angular resolution.High angular resolution HXR optics require detectors with a large number of fine pixels in order to adequately sample the telescope point spread function (PSF) over the entire field of view. Excessively over-sampling the PSF will increase readout noise and require more processing with no appreciable increase in image quality. An appropriate level of over-sampling is to have 3 pixels within the HPD. For the HERO mirrors, where the HPD is 26 arcsec over a 6-m focal length converts to 750 µm, the optimum pixel size is around 250 µm. At a 10-m focal length these detectors can support a 16 arcsec HPD. Of course, the detectors must also have high efficiency in the HXR region, good energy resolution, low background, low power requirements, and low sensitivity to radiation damage (Ramsey 2001). The ability to handle high counting rates is also desirable for efficient calibration.A collaboration between Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), MSFC, and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK is developing precisely such detectors under an ongoing, funded APRA program (FY2015 to FY2017). The detectors use the RAL-developed Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) dubbed HEXITEC, for High Energy X-Ray Imaging Technology. These HEXITEC ASICs can be bonded to 1- or 2- mm-thick Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) or Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) to create a fine (250 µm pitch) HXR detector (Jones et al. 2009; Seller et al. 2011). The objectives of this funded effort are to develop and test a HEXITEC-based detector system through the (1) design, manufacture, and test of front-end electronics instrument boards and (2) calibration of the detectors to assess their performance and (3) vibration and environmental testing. By the end of this program, multiple detector assemblies will be built and characterized, and can be used as part of future instruments.We propose to augment the existing effort with the development of an anti-coincidence shield for these HEXITEC-based detector assemblies to maximize sensitivity. Designing the anti-coincidence shield is enabled by the addition of a new team member, Wayne Baumgartner, who has recently and fortuitously joined the existing effort. Dr. Baumgartner has valuable and relevant past experience with a similar shield systems developed for NuSTAR and the InFOCµS x-ray telescope.We are asking for a modest amount of additional funding in this proposal year, as it coincides with a key time in the characterization and environmental testing of the detector assemblies. Characterization and environmental testing of the bare assemblies is already funded under the current effort. The addition of this active shield will allow for a more complete detector module vibration and environment test at the end of the existing development program so that this project results in a detector system with a demonstrated TRL of 6: ""System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.

"1016","AIRS/Aqua L3 Daily Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) 1 degree x 1 degree V006 (AIRS3STD) at GES DISC","The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","air-quality                        altitude                        atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        atmospheric-pressure                        atmospheric-radiation                        atmospheric-tempera...                        atmospheric-water-v...                        clouds                        earth-science                        land-surface                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        ocean-temperature                        oceans                        surface-radiative-p...                        surface-thermal-pro...","2019-12-13",NA

Ozone retrievals are generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. A Level-3 MZM file computes zonal means covering 5 degree latitude bands for each calendar month. For this product there are 154 months of data from October 2000 through July 2013. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere. Profile data are provided at 21 layers from 1013.25, 639.318, 403.382,254.517, 160.589, 101.325,63.9317, 40.3382, 25.4517, 16.0589, 10.1325, 6.39317,4.03382, 2.54517, 1.60589, 1.01325,0.639317, 0.403382, 0.254517, 0.160589 and 0.101325 hPa (measured at bottom of layer). NOTE: Some profiles have 20 layers and do not report the top most layer. Mixing ratios are reported at 15 layers from 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 and 50.0 hPa (measured at middle of layer).The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees). 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month. 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band. 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).","https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/jgrd.50597","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        earth-science                        national-geospatial...                        ngda","2013-08-14",NA

"1020","Miniaturized MMIC-Based Millimeter-Wave Frequency Synthesizers for Space Applications, Phase I","MMIC technology provides the technology base to reduce the size and weight of microwave and millimeter wave (MMW) equipment on board airborne and space-based platforms.  Signal sources at MMW frequencies, however, have not been available in MMIC form widely.  Hittite has developed a family of MMIC products to implement complete phase-locked synthesizers in using MMIC and mixed-signal ICs and demonstrated miniaturized frequency synthesizers representing size reduction of several orders of magnitude without sacrificing performance.  Based on recent success in demonstration of critical MMICs and ICs, Hittite proposes to apply its novel MMIC concept to design MMW signal sources for application in earth monitoring sensors.  Two different synthesizer architecture, one direct and one indirect, are proposed as candidate approaches.  In both cases, frequency synthesis will take place at about 1/8 of the output frequency and then translated up to the final output with a fixed tone. The proposed approach relies on components operating at lower frequencies for better phase noise performance, and the method is applicable to generation of higher frequencies. The proposed program will lead to a family of novel miniaturized MMIC products for commercial communications.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"1021","Robust Switching Control for Hypersonic Vehicles, Phase I","Flight in the hypersonic regime is critical to NASA's goals because access to earth orbit and re-entry from orbit to earth or to other planets with atmospheres require flight through this regime.  Hypersonic flight poses a wide array of difficulties, including significant guidance and control challenges.  For example, flexible airframes and highly integrated airframe and propulsion systems common in scramjet designs mean that aerodynamic and propulsion control are closely coupled.  Control laws for hypersonic vehicles must also handle a very broad range of dynamics as hypersonic vehicles often operate from subsonic through hypersonic speeds and possibly with multiple propulsion modes for different speed ranges.  Actuator saturation and significant models uncertainty also pose control challenges, and demanding energy management requirements make guidance and trajectory optimization challenging tasks as well.  The proposed research will develop innovative control strategies to address the challenges of hypersonic flight.  These will be based on recent advances in switching control methods that provide large stable regions and disturbance rejection guarantees in the presence of actuator saturation.  The proposed control methods will ultimately be integrated with advanced guidance approaches for hypersonic vehicles developed by Barron Associates.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

(OO), in collaboration with University of Texas (UT) at Austin and the George Washington University propose a novel 2D TCC-VCSEL arrays monolithically integrated with a surface-normal slow-light photonic crystal (PC) waveguide array that are vertically built in one lithography layer.  Unlike conventional thinking where the waveguides in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) are always built parallel to the substrate, which will require 64 lithographically defined waveguide layers to provide a 64×64 phase array. Due to the slow light effect, this system provides the required phase shift larger than liquid crystal with 30 µm interaction length while maintaining the pixel (emitter) to pixel separation small enough to cover the total field of view (FOV) of 180˚× 180˚, and the instantaneous field of view of 0.05˚.This will significantly increase the yield rate to the final targeted 98% since we have only one primarily defined lithography layer rather than a 64-layer approach without sacrificing the performance metrics.  The steering of the laser beam can be realized through two different means: (1) electro-optically controlled through carrier perturbation or refilling the hole with EO polymer and (2) through thermal tuning which provides the needed phase shift of each element with the sweeping speed of >100 KHz. The key claims are the following:1. Engineering the PC waveguide slow light device where the group index perturbation Δng can be significantly increased to 170-200, which will provide a much shorter waveguide length needed to steer the beam. 2. The unequally spaced design is capable of providing the side-lobe suppression up to 35 and 50 dB, respectively as required in phase I and phase II.  This achievement is due to the design of non-overlapping sidelobes and the unequally coupled optical intensity of each element created by each subarray while maintaining a single steerable peak with the required IFOV and TFOV.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

Environments such as Matlab/IDL allow ease of use, but unless simulations are extremely fast, they cannot be used naturally.Many large-scale numerical calculations require storage and computation that grow as the square/cube of the number of variables, including such linear algebra operations as solving dense linear systems, computing eigen-values/vectors, and others. The use of fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method (FMM) coupled with iterative methods allows many problems of interest to be solved in near linear time and memory. We have taken a leadership role in applying and extending the FMM to various problems in acoustics, fluid flow, electromagnetics, function fitting and machine learning.Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are now ubiquitous in game consoles, in workstations and other devices and are special purpose processors for graphics, that are predicted to shortly achieve performance in the hundreds of gigaflop range for specialized calculations (much faster than COTS PCs) at low price points.It is conceivable now to equip personal workstations with several CPUs and GPUs, and solve problems with millions or billions of variables quickly using fast algorithms. We will take an important algorithm with wide applicability: the FMM, and implement it on the widely available heterogeneous CPU/GPU architecture, and prove the feasibility of accelerating it tremendously. A fundamental reconsideration of the algorithm that maps appropriate pieces on to the correct part of the architecture forms the basis of our approach. Developed software will be tested, and benchmark problems solved. A library of software that will support the porting of the FMM and other scientific computing to the CPU/GPU architecture will be developed.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

"1030","On The Performance Comparison of Gradient Type Joint-Process Est","In adaptive signal processing, joint process estimation playsan important role in various estimation problems. It is wellknown that a joint process estimator consists of two struc-tures, namely the orthogonalizer and the regression filter. Inliterature, orthogonalization step is performed either by or-thogonal transformations or by linear predictors. While theorthogonal transformations do not preserve entropy; thepredictors, such as the lattice, do preserve it. However, thesteady-state performance of such linear predictors is not asgood as those of the orthogonal transformations. Latticefilters do not perform perfect orthogonalization when theyoperate as gradient-based adaptive predictors. In this work,adaptive escalator predictor is proposed to be used as theorthogonalizer of the joint process estimator. The proposedmethod preserves the entropy and achieves perfect orthogo-nalization at all times. Moreover it has good steady-stateperformance compared to those structures utilizing gradientadaptive lattice filters.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

The data are updated monthly with new images acquired by Landsat 8 that are then paired with older images acquired within 400 days of the new acquisition for the Antarctic ice sheet, 112 days for the Greenland ice sheet, and 96 days for all other glacierized areas. The data are generated by an image correlation algorithm that produces grids of ice displacement referenced to in-image rock outcrops, slow moving ice, or if lacking that, using the satellite's geo-positioning (accurate to +/- 5 m).

Of particular interest is a hybrid carbon/SiC matrix composite utilizing carbon fiber.  This class of composite, which utilizes Phenolic prepreg to form the initial composite structure, lends itself to the fabrication of large very complex structures.  Typically, these composites are densified via PIP processing.  However, there are deficiencies in this material system.  The nature of PIP processing results in an appreciable amount of open porosity, requiring a CVD SiC external coating for oxidation protection.

"1049","On laser sensor image fringe detection and mitigation in real-time processing based on firmware supported Hilbert-Huang Transform for 2-Dimensions","In physics, interference is a phenomenon in which two waves superimpose to form a new complex wave and fringes are observed wherever the two or more waves overlap. Fringe analysis has a wide range of applications in physical and engineering measurements interpretation and its state-of-the-art static processing is using linearity-assumed Fourier Transform that is inadequate due to fringe non-linear and non-stationary nature. This breakthrough technology for optical testbed verification experiments and fringe analysis, as well as phase unwrapping of spaceflight grade optical components and systems, is based on firmware supported dynamic near real-time Hilbert-Huang Transform for 2-dimensions (HHT2-Fringe). The image of a laser source through quartz substrate of the filter wheel or enclosure on the CCD detector is prone to unwanted interference fringes due to the impurities of quartz material. Applying antireflection coatings on both sides of the substrate could substantially reduce these fringes but does not remove them completely. Alternatively, the interference fringes analogous to Moire pattern could be removed statically using image processing after the in-situ measurement or dynamically while an experiment is in process. It’s highly beneficial to eliminate these patterns dynamically using a near-real time processing. The benefit is due itself to the dynamic and nonlinear nature of these fringes where the beam source location could change at any angle. However, the static fringe analysis is using linearity-based Fourier Transforms and the dynamic fringe analysis techniques are in embryonic state.One innovative approach to detect and remove the unwanted fringes dynamically is by applying the combination of the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD2) and the Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA2) for 2-dimensions and specifically researching and developing the HHT2 into fringe detection and mitigation engineering tool HHT2-Fringe. The EMD2 and HSA2 comprise the Hilbert-Huang Transforms for 2-dimensions or HHT2 that was recently accomplished within the Goddard internal research and development program (IRAD). The HHT2 is designed specifically for analyzing data from nonlinear and non-stationary processes in 2-dimensions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

The MACTWP_mean field can also be used as a quality-control screen for the MACLWP_mean field as discussed in Elsaesser et al. (2017), where uncertainty increases as the ratio of cloud to total water path increases.  The MAC-LWP algorithm uses as input the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) Version 7 0.25 degree-resolution retrieval products (produced using the SSM/I, AMSR-E, TMI, AMSR-2, GMI, SSMIS, and WindSat satellite sensors), and performs a bias correction on all input RSS cloud water path products based on AMSR-E matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes.  The MAC-LWP algorithm ensures that spurious trends and variability in the cloud fields arising from drifting satellite overpass times are mitigated by simultaneously solving for the monthly average cloud and total water paths and monthly-mean diurnal cycles, as discussed in O’Dell et al.

In Phase I we developed and delivered to NASA a 320x256 DUALBAND FPA integrated in a dewar cooler assembly (IDCA) that produces simultaneous and spatially-registered imagery in two spectral bands, namely, a fire channel in the 3-5 micron window and a thermal channel covering 8-12 microns. Such FPAs are known to be uniquely effective for detecting wildfires either locally from aircraft or globally from satellites in low earth orbit. The performance of SLS detectors now rivals that of mercury cadmium telluride but at a fraction of the cost. Their high quantum efficiency combined with the advantages of two-color imagery and data interpretation will permit the detection of wildfires with much reduced false alarm rates. The same devices will also enhance NASA's capabilities in a host of other satellite and airborne Earth-observing missions devoted to long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, atmosphere and oceans. They will also be instrumental in supporting future Space Science missions aimed at studying distant galaxies and discovering potentially habitable planets orbiting other stars. In Phase II we will expand dualband FPA format to 1280x1024 (12 micron pitch) and develop and deliver both a compact IDCA and camera so that NASA can field-test this promising new sensor technology for its wildfire-detection and other remote-sensing missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"1060","Automatic Generation of Least-Possible-Impact Traffic Management Initiatives, Phase I","Weather accounts for 70% of the annual cost of air traffic delays and cancellations, of which about 60% are estimated to be avoidable. Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs), including reroutes and ground delays, are used by Air Traffic Management (ATM) operators to mitigate impact of en-route convective weather. The efficiency of today's TMIs leaves a great deal to be desired, due in part to insufficient accuracy of today's weather forecast products. As new, higher-accuracy probabilistic forecast products are beginning to emerge, there is a major functionality gap between their visual aspect (enhancing comprehension and decision making by operators) and their application in automated NextGen ATM decision support tools. Our proposal seeks to address this gap. We will develop a prototype tool for automatic generation of ""Least-Impact TMIs"" using probabilistic convective forecast information. This tool will generate a combination of least-deviation-from-shortest-path reroute and/or minimum ground delay for each flight predicted to be impacted by convective weather.Innovation in this proposal:•   New, original ""step-out-and-scan"" rerouting algorithm.•   Probabilistic forecast information converted to ATM constraints (""permeability"") and used to find viable reroute paths.•   Combination of economical reroutes plus minimum delays resulting in least-impact traffic management solutions.We already have a suitable platform for this research: the WITI (Weather Impacted Traffic Index) toolset developed by Principal Investigator, Dr. Klein, funded by the FAA and the National Weather Service. It can ingest actual and forecast weather, traffic demand, airport and airspace capacities; as well as compute weather permeability by a flight (using the so-called scanning algorithm) and airspace capacity degradation due to weather.

"1061","Silicon Wafer X-ray Mirror Project","We propose to undertake the initial development of a Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) type X-ray mirror using the relatively recent availability of high quality, inexpensive, silicon wafers as reflectors. Proof of suitability will lead to the fabrication of a new class of lightweight X-ray mirrors for astronomical observations with suitably large effective area and moderate spatial resolution. We intend to build a demonstration unit, which uses multiple silicon wafers aligned in a housing structure, and test it with X-rays to show angular resolution, <30”, at the end of the project.  In this one year research project, we propose to do the following four tasks; (1) Design the silicon wafer X-ray mirror demo unit and develop a ray-tracing code to estimate the mirror performance. We will need to determine detailed parameters of the unit, such as size of the silicon wafer, their angle and pitch. (2) We have to find a wafer processed by the “right” method suitable for our application: appropriately flat and thin. We will procure the silicon wafers and measure the surface flatness using an optical interferometer. (3) Design a holding structure of the silicon wafer and place them in the K-B system configuration. The structure should be able to place the wafers in micron accuracy. If the machining accuracy doesn’t allow us to do this, we would need to develop a method to align the wafer. (4) Once we have the manufacturing drawing, we will need to identify the manufacturer and fabricate the designed housing. Then we will assemble the first demonstration unit, and measure its performance at the X-ray beamline. The X-ray test results will be compared with ray-tracing simulations and used for the further developments in the future.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

The neurodiagnostic monitor should be lightweight and compact and should require minimal time or effort for the crew to use. The device should be unobtrusive enough to allow mission operations to be performed during monitoring. In Phase 1 of the program, we were able to successfully monitor cortical activity using multi-parameter sensor modules. In addition to electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals that provided the electrophysiological and cortical oxygenation information, we were able to obtain photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals to compute the heart rate and frequency of eye movement. In Phase 1 we also demonstrated the functionality of an algorithm that automatically classifies the varying degrees of cognitive loading based on the measured physiological parameters. In the proposed Phase 2 program, we will develop a flight-capable neurodiagnostic device that can be unobtrusively worn on the head.

"1069","Cryogenic Cooling System for Zero-Venting Storage of Supercritical Air Packs, Phase I","Supercritical air at cryogenic temperature is an attractive source of breathing air because of its very high density and low pressure.  However, heat leak into the cryogenic tank causes the stored air to expand and vent, thus limiting the storage life of a charged system.  We propose to develop a storage system for supercritical air tanks that provides cryogenic cooling that will intercept heat leaks to prevent venting and enable long-term storage of charged, supercritical air tanks.  The innovative, mechanical cryocooling system provides flexible coupling and quick disconnection from the storage tanks, as well as high reliability and efficient, low-power operation.  In addition to storage, the system can be used to charge the tanks with supercritical air without the use of expendable cryogens.  In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of the system through design trade-off and optimization analyses that will produce a conceptual design and operational description of a supercritical air storage system.  The system will be designed to store multiple units of NASA?s existing supercritical air self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) system.

Advanced Space proposes developing the means for flying spacecraft in an orbit that remains below 10 km altitude for weeks or months, opening the door to breakthrough scientific investigations. The proposed work will study an innovative system that may be used to achieve Sustained Low-Altitude Lunar Orbital Missions (SLALOM), enabled through autonomous onboard GNC capabilities and the use of Flash LIDAR.The proposed study explores the dynamics of SLALOM, performs navigation analyses, evaluates maneuver planning methodologies, and researches how unique innovations in spacecraft autonomy can transfer operations from the ground to the spacecraft. Skimming the lunar surface autonomously with a spacecraft that remains below an altitude of 10 km is a challenging proposition that requires an entirely new approach to spacecraft navigation, maneuver design and execution, and spacecraft autonomy. SLALOM, with the requisite breakthrough improvements in guidance, navigation, and control technology, allows new scientific investigations such as the direct sensing and/or capture of lunar particles naturally lofted by the complicated dynamics of the lunar exosphere.The benefits of the proposed innovation in spacecraft autonomy extend naturally to other airless bodies where sustained low-altitude orbits are mission enabling. These include, among others, the scientific and commercial exploration of asteroids and the Martian satellites Phobos and Deimos. While these applications are compelling, Advanced Space identifies the Moon as an ideal proving ground for this technology for many reasons, not least of which is to take advantage of the wealth of geodetic reference data generated by previous missions and the desire for low-altitude, high value scientific investigations identified by the lunar science community.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"1083","MSDT - A Central Executive to Coordinate Rapid Mission and Spacecraft Design, Phase I","The integrated design centers currently in place at the Goddard and Ames research institutions are highly productive infrastructures, allowing a group of domain specialists to rally for intense, focused intervals of time around a mission concept, refining a design in spiral fashion using a palette of trusted in-house and commercial engineering analysis tools. This approach can be significantly streamlined if a standard data exchange mechanism is established between the elements of the toolchain and a centralized function is included to govern the initiation and management of design projects. DNet has developed the Mission and Satellite Design Tool (MSDT) for AFRL, which is the starting point for the creation of tactical satellites. MSDT will accept objectives for a mission and distill them to a spacecraft configuration, drawing from a database of support devices and modular software. MSDT also coordinates the assessment of that satellite configuration, interacting with traditional analysis tools to perform domain analysis and return measures of performance which can be compared to the original objectives. DNet proposes to enhance the current framework capability to be compatible with NASA's preferred analysis tools and provide a springboard for the development of the SBIRSat and subsequent missions based on its supporting technologies.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

Bush issued a Vision for Space Exploration that included a return to the lunar surface by as early as 2015.  This mission is expected to undertake far more ambitious activities than those of the previous Apollo mission, possibly involving medium to long term lunar habitation.  The use of inflatable structures for large-volume crew habitation on the lunar surface has proven to be an effective technology to maximize payload volumes and reduce overall launch costs.

"1092","High Transparent Metal Oxide / Polyimide Antistatic Coatings, Phase I","NASA requires clear antistatic coatings that can withstand exposure to the rigors of the space environment. Agiltron proposes a coating consisting of inorganic conducting particles and space environment resistant polymer that shares the best features of inorganics and organics currently available. Such a coating could potentially be processed by common polymeric routes yet have the optical/electrical performance advantages of inorganic materials. The electric resistance of the coating can be easily adjusted by changing the composition and concentration of the inorganic conducting particles for a resistance required for antistatic applications (106-1010 ohm/sq). This new material system would overcome traditional drawbacks, such as the light scattering due to the aggregation of the inorganic particles, providing the high transparency and desired conductivity for many applications. Elimination of light scattering is achieved by dispersing transparent conducting particles into an optically matched polymer matrix. Moreover, the transparent and conducting particles are designed to chemically bond to the engineered polymer composite for excellent stability and reliability that are required in space environment applications. The process of applying this type of transparent antistatic film is as simple as applying paint, which would allow the application of these coatings to flexible and rigid materials suggesting potential even in very cost-sensitive applications.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        kennedy-space-center",NA,NA

"1103","Detectors with Improved Near-to-Mid IR Performance and Reduced Cooling Requirements, Phase II","This program will develop an ultra-high performance infrared detector manufacturing technology with improved performance and cost effectiveness, and reduced cooling requirements when compared to the best commercially available HgCdTe and InGaAs detectors. This will be accomplished using a two-pronged approach addressing both device design and materials. First, the conventional pn photodiode device is replaced with a new device structure, the nBn detector, which inherently suppresses performance-limiting dark currents, such as those produced by surface leakage. Second, highly manufacturable III-V materials are used, which are further enhanced with Amethyst's proprietary UV hydrogenation defect mitigation process. The result is a low cost, high performance detectors operating in the 2  5 micron wavelength region. There is a pressing need for ultra-high sensitivity detectors operating in this region for the detection of trace gases and chemicals.In Phase I Amethyst produced a 2.8 micron cutoff detector.  The program met all objectives, demonstrating considerable improvements in performance over conventional pn diodes using the nBn and hydrogenation approach.  In Phase II, Amethyst will design, fabricate and test high performance detectors individually optimized with cutoff wavelengths throughout 25 micron wavelength range.  These detectors will have improved detectivity, and significantly reduced cooling requirements compared to currently available commercial detectors.  In addition, Amethyst will deliver a thermoelectrically cooled 3.3 micron wavelength cutoff detector to JPL's Microdevices Laboratory for comparative testing and to assist in development of methane detector systems. The overall objective of the Phase II is to establish performance metrics, manufacturing process, characterize and life test single element devices.

The innovation is a  multi-scale model that extends experimental and detailed high-level physics characterization of microfluidic components to full-scale ESP microfluidic network performance through an engineering tool with a central database of critical microfluidic properties.  The tool is designed to allow ESP system engineers to efficiently narrow down the system component trade space and thereby substantially reduce the development time of advanced ESP systems.  The physics underlying a microfluidic network of an ESP system covers multiple scale lengths that render the application of high-level CFD or atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over the entire system impractical.  ESPET takes an engineering model approach that breaks the ESP system down into multiple microfluidic components or domains that can be described by analytical microfluidic solutions and specific parameters of the domain.

"1112","Homogenization and Optimization of Electrodes and Photovoltaic Cells with Periodic Nanoscopic Geometry","The purpose of this proposal is to design a completely propellantless spacecraft control system using magnetic actuators. The operational life and cost of a spacecraft is heavily influenced by its mass which makes propellantless spacecraft control systems an attractive alternative. An electrodynamic tether is a long conducting wire on a spacecraft that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field thereby exchanging orbital angular momentum with the Earth's rotational angular momentum. Electrodynamic tethers can either convert orbital energy into electricity or vice versa. Magnetic torque coils are coils placed on a spacecraft such that when current is passed through the coils in the presence of Earth's magnetic field, a torque is generated which causes an exchange of momentum. Magnetic torque coils provide a propellantless torque which can be used to rotate a spacecraft. However, they cannot generate a torque about the axis parallel to the magnetic field meaning that this axis will be uncontrollable. The goal of this proposal is to compensate for the lack of control by investigating a system consisting of both magnetic torque coils and electrodynamic tethers in order to generate a torque about the uncontrolled axis. My work will focus on the dynamics of the combined system as well as control laws to produce desired attitude or orbit changes. This project can benefit many mission types, especially small satellites that launch as secondary payloads. The ability to change orbit and perform any required attitude maneuvers without the use of propellant will be beneficial to any mission.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed",NA,NA

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates.

"1121","UAM Disturbance Rejection in Conceptual Design, Phase I","Complex and often violent urban wind environments pose a significant challenge to the safety and ride quality for vehicles intended for the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market. UAM aircraft concepts must have control authority, turbulence rejection, and ride comfort as figures of merit at the forefront of the configuration selection process. However, the evaluation of handling qualities has traditionally been late in the design process when most of a vehicle's characteristics are established. Advanced design methods in early conceptual design are just recently adopting the use of physics-based aircraft dynamics models to identify handling quality metrics and educate the configuration down selection process. Attempts to extend those tools into unique VTOL configurations designed for the UAM market are not ubiquitous due to the increased complexity and diversity of VTOL concepts.Empirical Systems Aerospace, Inc., (ESAero) will develop a quantitative ride quality assessment methodology and accompanying tool suite to enable the analysis and down-selection of eVTOL configurations during the conceptual design process. ESAero will leverage previous development of 6DoF dynamics simulations of vehicles with distributed electric propulsion (DEP) control authority to integrate handling qualities into the design and configuration process where system level changes are least expensive. Physics-based models in ESAero’s Propulsion Airframe iNTegration for Hybrid Electric Research (PANTHER) tool suite will be extended to scalable dynamics models for the latest eVTOL propulsion technologies such as electric ducted fans (EDF) and small, distributed propellers. ESAero’s recent expansion of OpenVSP/VSPAERO to characterize handling qualities will be utilized in the creation of the dynamics simulations.  By leveraging OpenVSP, PANTHER, and physics based 6DoF simulation, this effort will enable rapid evaluation of handling qualities at the forefront of the conceptual design process.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        ames-research-center",NA,NA
"1122","Advanced Materials and Manufacturing for Low-Cost, High-Performance Liquid Rocket Combustion Chambers, Phase II","Silicided niobium alloy (C103) combustion chambers have been used extensively in both NASA and DoD liquid rocket propulsion systems. Niobium alloys offer a good combination of temperature capability, density, and cost, while the silicide coating has been successful in providing moderate oxidation resistance and use temperature. However, for many current applications the silicide coating is now proving to be the limiting factor in achieving the required chamber performance and/or lifetime, and the chamber manufacturing cost is excessive. NASA is seeking advanced bipropellant propulsion systems for Earth science spacecraft and space exploration vehicles, while DoD is seeking economical and high-performance bipropellant thrusters for liquid divert and attitude control systems in kinetic energy kill vehicles for ballistic missile defense (a high-volume application). These goals cannot be achieved using standard silicided C103 chambers. In this project, Ultramet proposes to develop and demonstrate a combustion chamber with substantially improved manufacturability, cost, and performance. In Phase I, Ultramet successfully demonstrated both improved chamber manufacturing and a more robust and higher performance oxidation-resistant coating as a replacement for the silicide. This was accomplished through a unique manufacturing process involving low temperature spray deposition of C103 on removable plastic mandrels produced by rapid prototyping. Thin vapor-deposited platinum coatings were shown to substantially improve oxidation resistance relative to the standard silicide coating. In Phase II, Ultramet will expand upon the Phase I results by performing a comprehensive optimization of the combustion chamber processing including mandrel development, cold-spray material/process optimization, and oxidation-resistant coating optimization. Performance will then be demonstrated through hot-fire testing.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA
"1123","An Efficient Heat Exchanger for In Situ Resource Utilization, Phase I","In situ resource utilization (ISRU) is essential for several of NASA's future flagship missions.  Currently envisioned ISRU plants include production of oxygen from hydrogen reduction of lunar regolith and extraction of water from Martian regolith or asteroid material.  These ISRU processes require heating of the regolith to high reaction temperatures.  Once the reaction is complete, most thermal energy exits the system in the spent regolith batch and is therefore wasted.  Creare proposes to recover this heat and use it to preheat fresh regolith prior to entering the reactor.  Our novel heat recovery design is purely passive, robust, and compact to accommodate tight mass and volume constraints.  Our heat exchanger promises to recover 80% of the otherwise wasted thermal energy.  This energy savings can either be used to reduce the power plant size or speed up the production rates of the ISRU system.  The Creare team has firsthand knowledge of the current ISRU research status and has the necessary background in mechanical design, heat exchanger design, as well as the facilities and commercialization expertise, to make this project a success.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA

Biophysical Parameters derived from the FASIR-NDVI (Fourier Adjusted, Solar zenith angle correction, Interpolation, and Reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data set developed for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection for the months of January 1982 through December 1998 were used to calculate monthly mean surface albedos at 1 X 1 degree spatial resolution for vegetated land surfaces (Sellers et al, 1996b) for the wavelength interval from 0.4 to 3.0 mm. The instantaneous albedo is a function of the properties of the land surface and the solar zenith angle. The monthly mean albedo is an average weighted over time weighted by the incident radiation. NDVI data are used to generate the biophysical parameters leaf area index (LAI) and green fraction of vegetation (Greenness) used by the canopy radiative transfer model of the Simple Biosphere (SiB2) model (Sellers et al, 1996a), which computes the instantaneous albedo. This is coupled to the Colorado State University (CSU) General Circulation Model (GCM) (Randall et al, 1989) which integrates the SiB2 radiative transfer through time. The incident radiation for weighting the time-averaged albedo was provided by a previous run of the GCM using the atmospheric radiation parameterization of Harshvardhan et al (1987). The Harshvardhan parameterization models radiative transfer through the atmosphere in both the longwave and shortwave bands, including the effects of cloudiness and water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone. The shortwave radiation distinguishes between the direct and diffuse components of the solar beam.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","biosphere                        earth-science                        land-surface                        land-use-land-cover                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        surface-radiative-p...                        vegetation","public",NA

A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees). 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month. 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band. 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).","https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/jgrd.50597","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        earth-science                        national-geospatial...                        ngda","2013-06-07",NA

Recently, we have been able to demonstrate the shape memory effect  in these foams, which is a unique capability.   Unlike solid, monolithic TiNi, the open-celled foam structure allows for very rapid response times when immersed in fluids, such as hot water or hot air. The SHS process makes net shape components, and so the cost of the tube can be dramatically reduced, and can have features introduced into the end of the tube to allow for simple torque transfer into a structure.  Thus, in developing a foam torque tube using SHS, all of the key obstacles to its incorporation into existing aerostructures can be resolved, while preserving the key benefits of a lightweight, solid-state structure.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

"1148","Single-Aperture GPS-based Attitude (GPS/A) Sensor for Spin-Stabilized Platforms, Phase II","Attitude determination of spin-stabilized platforms is especially challenging. Current low-cost gyroscope technology does not lend itself to attitude determination of platforms spinning in excess of one rotation per second. Traditional GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensors require three or more antenna elements separated by large baselines. Single-element designs require extensive calibration of the satellite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and are not very accurate. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a small, single-aperture low-cost GPS/A sensor for space launch vehicles, and to demonstrate the sensor in an operational environment. The sensor determines the platform attitude with a single GPS antenna having a diameter of approximately 6.5 cm. The standalone performance of Toyon's GPS/A sensor on a spinning platform is better than 2.1 degrees for roll, and better than 1.2 degrees for yaw and pitch (one-sigma). The system performance can be further improved when integrated with accelerometers and/or magnetometers. Although current low-cost gyroscope technology does not allow their use on spinning platforms, non-spinning platforms may take advantage of gyro measurements for further improvements in attitude performance. During the proposed Phase II program Toyon will develop, build and test a prototype system that will be delivered for validation onboard an actual space launch vehicle.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"1149","Modular Power System Configured with Standard Product Hybrid DC-DC Converters, Phase I","VPT proposes an innovative concept whereby complex, multiple-output, DC-DC converter systems can be configured through use of only 2 standard product hybrid DC-DC Converter modules.  The key module attributes that make this feasible are: programmable output, parallel current-sharing capability, synchronization capability, dual (plus and minus) output voltage, 500V input-output-case isolation, external shutdown, total dose and single event effects radiation hardening, and ability to be element evaluated, screened, and qualified to MIL PRF 38534 Class K (space flight) standards.  Once these attributes are satisfied, it is shown that highly complex systems can be designed and delivered with a minimum of nonrecurring engineering.  This includes 28V or 100V input systems, low voltage and higher voltage outputs, and highly varying output power.  The system allows output series operation for increased output voltage, as well as input series operation to accommodate increased input voltages.  This is all accomplished without the need of a centralized controller.  This confines most of the common failure modes to graceful degradation as opposed to catastrophic shut down.

There are numerous situations, however, where the faint sounds collected using an ordinary stethoscope are overwhelmed by ambient noise.  Such is the case in spacecraft, where room is scarce and noise generating equipment is always nearby.  Here, a stethoscope employing laser Doppler vibrometry is proposed.  Through an innovative design employing adaptive filtering, the new-technology stethoscope will provide immunity to external noise while providing conventional auscultation sounds for easy interpretation by medical professionals.  Phase I and Phase II development will result in a system that is lightweight, rugged, efficient, and compact, making it suitable for use in space.  The system will provide enhanced medical care for astronauts in space, allowing auscultation sounds to be transmitted back to mission control medical personnel despite the high levels of ambient noise present in the spacecraft.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

Estimates of daily primary productivity (PP) will be computed using the Ocean Productivity from Absorption of Light (OPAL) model. OPAL vertically resolves phytoplankton absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and relates the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient to sea-surface temperature (SST), where SST is a proxy for seasonal changes in the phytoplankton community. OPAL will be validated with new field measurements of PP including dissolved organic carbon production.Field measurements of particulate (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the absorption coefficients of phytoplankton (aph) and colored dissolved organic matter (aCDOM) will allow us to extend the validation range (temporally and spatially) for our coastal algorithms and reduce the uncertainties in satellite-derived estimates of OPAL PP, POC, DOC, aph and aCDOM. Furthermore, we will apply our extensive field data to derive region-independent ocean color algorithms for PP, POC, DOC aCDOM and aph using machine learning approaches. We will rigorously validate and compare band-ratio and multivariate machine learning algorithms. Algorithms validated from this study will be applied to satellite observations to produce a time  series of satellite data productsThe U.S. Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB), George's Bank (GB) and Gulf of Maine (GoM) stand at the crossroads between major ocean circulation features - the Gulf Stream and Labrador slope-sea and shelf currents - and are influenced by highly variable river discharge, summer upwelling, warm core rings, and intense seasonal stratification. Our work will focus on the impacts of variable river discharge, SST and large-scale climate indices on primary production, and POC and DOC distributions. These processes are not unique to the MAB and GoM. Consequently, the results from this activity can be applied to understanding how inter-annual and long-term variability in climate patterns can impact the carbon cycle of continental margins throughout the globe.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","OB.DAAC","earth-science                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        ocean-chemistry                        ocean-optics                        ocean-temperature                        oceans                        salinity-density","public",NA
"1154","Interface Anywhere","Current paradigms for crew interfaces to the systems that require control are constrained by decades old technologies which require the crew to be physically near an input device to interact with the system.   Often this requires an interruption to move to a specific worksite which has a keyboard and/or the device they need to interact with.   This project demonstrated it is possible and practical to use a combination of voice and gesture to control systems while greatly enhancing the range of locations the user can operate the system from.  Evaluation feedback from engineering peers echoed our thoughts on the possibilities for these control modalities, but more importantly, offered critical feedback on what they perceived as intuitive voice and gestures and also emphasized the need for improved reliability.   Ultimately this project established a basis for identifying areas for further investigation in order to design a natural user interface that offers inherently reliable system control and has stimulated interest and participation from multiple academic institutions.To illustrate the viability of this technology, a prototype Natural User Interface (NUI) was developed as a proof-of-concept for system control.  Gesture and voice controls were developed and compared.   Both methods of control input allowed the user to be in a general area as opposed to a specific location.   Voice input highlighted the ability to achieve truly hands-free interaction. The prototype provided for control of a simplistic lighting system and cabin temperature control system which represented a typical space habitat system requiring interaction.  The user interacted with the system through a Microsoft Kinect sensor which includes an infrared light source and receiver and array microphone capability.   Code was developed in conjunction with the skeleton tracking and speech recognition capabilities in the software development kit to allow the use of gestures and speech as a source of input.  To allow the user to monitor system response and to 'see' the results of their commands, a simple set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were developed to include the logical equivalent of commands and telemetry feedback.   In addition, an end effector unit was developed using an Arduino microprocessor which received serial port inputs from the application software to control light emitting diodes which represented habitat light systems and a servo motor which represented an air mixing valve that might be used to support temperature control setpoint.   To interact with the system, the user began with a main display where they could navigate to the lighting controls display and a thermal control display.  The lighting controls consisted of on-off buttons for three areas of the simulated habitat (lab, crew quarters, airlock). Using voice commanding, the user could control the lights in each habitation area (e.g., ""lab off"" would select the off button). Gesture control employed both the left and right arms. Once the participant told the system to track their arm, a focus box would move over the lighting controls as controlled by the left hand. Once the focus box was over the desired on-off control, the button would be activated by a wave of the right hand. On the thermal control screen, a slider was shown with setpoint values ranging from 62 and 82 degrees. Using simple voice commands such as ""temp 70"", the setpoint indicator would move to that temperature. When the participant told the system to track the hand, the slider would move in parallel with the right hand. To stay at a specific temperature, the participant simply told the system to stop tracking.   The appropriate lights on the end-effector unit would turn on/off consistent with the GUI indications and the servo would move to a position in its range of motion that was scaled to be consistent with the temperature setpoint command.

The proposed research will study several innovative aspects of SAW sensor technology, including: new piezoelectric materials which can operate over large temperature ranges; new SAW device embodiments for measurement of temperature and pressure and their wireless transmission in multi-sensor environments; transceiver design and optimization given the SAW operating parameters; and innovative packaging and antenna considerations for rugged, small devices.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        kennedy-space-center",NA,NA
"1157","Task Allocation Using Continuous Resource Distributed Markov Decision Processes","Exploration of other planets will require teams of robotic rovers to first precede and later assist human explorers. A critical challenge will then be to generate plans for these rovers so as to maximize their productivity while minimizing the time and energy spent to complete a set of tasks. The tasks assigned to an agent may feature temporal constraints as well as complex interdependencies with other tasks, including those assigned to another agent. Numerous techniques have been developed to efficiently compute policies for a single agent using continuous resource Markov Decision Processes (CR-MDP). However, expanding such algorithms to situations involving multiple agents is difficult, given that the complexity of solving decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) has been shown to be NEXP-complete. Even when using approximate algorithms, it is difficult to achieve the scale-up necessary to model the size and complexity of real-world domains using distributed CR-MDPs (CR-DEC-MDP). I intend to explore methods for solving CR-DEC-MDPs more efficiently, including (1) fast, locally optimal methods that exploit domain structure; and (2) efficient methods of convolution using fast Fourier transform (FFT).","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed",NA,NA

The HSRL system uses a high power, pulsed, seeded Nd:YAG laser, whose seed is wavelength-stabilized to an iodine vapor absorption line.  The primary goal of the Phase II effort is to provide a robust, next generation seed laser system which is significantly reduced in size, weight, and required ""wall-plug"" power for HSRL and other lidar applications.  This approach is enabled by use of a suitable compact laser diode source, together with AdvR's integrated Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) technology.  Furthermore, AdvR's multi-element waveguide technology will be utilized in this Phase II effort to provide a compact 355nm source, derived from the same seed laser, for calibration of the HSRL UV interferometric filter.  A compact, next generation seed laser system utilizing AdvR's PLC and UV technology, integrated with a high performance compact laser diode source will advance NASA's lidar systems due to its compact, efficient, and reliable design, thus enabling use on small aircraft and satellites.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"1164","Measuring Sediment Flux at a Mars Analog Site Using Multilayer Solid-State Saltation Sensors.","Description of the science goals and objectives: This proposal will determine the utility of using multi-layer solid-state saltation sensors (e.g. SENSIT(tm) Saltation Sensor) to measure sediment flux at a Mars analog site in lieu of sediment collectors. We will use previously funded sediment collectors (BSNEs) and anemometers to calibrate the sediment flux from the multi-layer solid-state saltation sensors (MLS4) as a function of kinetic energy and particle counts. In addition to measuring sediment flux, we will characterize the thermal stability of the boundary layer by using a series of temperature sensors mounted on a pole. Instabilities within the boundary layer may cause changes to the vertical distribution of the sediment flux.Brief description of the methodology:This proposal will augment a previously (and ongoing) Mars analog study site with two additional pieces of instrumentation: (1) MLS4 and (2) a set of multi-layer temperature sensors. We plan to extend the collection of field data from the previously funded instrumentation (sediment collectors and anemometers) to calibrate an algorithm to convert the MLS4 kinetic energy and particle count rates into sediment flux. We will monitor the atmospheric temperature profile to determine if thermal instabilities affect this calibration algorithm.Relevance of the proposed research: This proposal is relevant to two of the three areas of fidelity.Science: The Grand Falls dune field site is a local area (40 miles from the PI's institution) with high winds, active dunes and a range of precipitation and temperatures. This proposal will continue the collection of an additional year of sediment flux measurements. This additional year of data will allow for the analysis of interannual variability. The additional instrumentation to measure the near-surface atmosphere temperature profile will help determine the air stability and compare that to sediment flux rates.Technology: This proposal will test the deployment, feasibility, and calibration of MLS4 as an instrument package to measure sediment flux rates with no moving parts. We will develop the necessary protocols and procedures that will be needed to calibrate the data under conditions when concurrent sediment collectors and wind observations are not available. This instrument package could either be deployed to Mars (or perhaps Titan) on a rover (e.g. as part of the mast) or as a lander.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"1165","A Robust Biofilm-Biomat Reactor for Conversion of Mission-Relevant Feedstocks to Products, Phase I","Sustainable Bioproducts (SB) proposes to develop an encapsulated biofilm-biomat reactor that will efficiently convert mission relevant feedstocks to usable products under zero gravity conditions. The bioreactor will be based on SB’s proprietary fermentation platform for converting a wide variety of waste streams into a multitude of usable products. SB’s bioreactor platform is simple, does not require energy during fermentation (other than temperature control), requires little water, and produces a very dense, easily harvested, consolidated/textured biomats with little to no waste. The biofilm-biomat fermentation technology enables growth on extreme media such as human waste (urine/feces) and produces a highly consolidated and textured biomass without the requirement of a separation or concentration step. Relatively high biomass production rates (0.55 g/L/h dry biomass) and high culture densities (100-180 g/L) are achieved without the need for active aeration or agitation. Scale-up of the system vertically or horizontally is simple and does not result in decreased productivity. The NASA sponsored research will optimize conversion of mission relevant feedstocks (human waste, food waste, plant materials) by adjusting reactor design and growth conditions. The biofilm-biomats produced in the optimized reactor system will be highly textured, 0.2 to 2.5 cm thick with a dry matter content of 10-18% and can be readily used for mission critical needs such as meat alternatives, other appetizing foods, fuels and building materials.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        ames-research-center",NA,NA
"1166","In-Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing, Phase II","In Phase I of this project MLPC, WSU, and AFIT were successfully able to identify several optical data features that are indicative of the quality of components built with the selective laser melting additive manufacturing process.  Four unique optical sensors were identified to collect this information and they include infrared and visible wavelength high-speed cameras and spectrometers.  The sensors used in Phase I were very expensive, university developed, and produce very big data sets.  In this phase II proposal MLPC and their collaborators will continue this work by developing a new low-cost sensor system to specifically track key data features identified in Phase I.  This sensor system will then be used to perform in-process quality monitoring and qualification of manufactured parts.  In Phase II this analysis will also be extended to electron beam freeform fabrication.  To complete the project MLPC, WSU, and AFIT will continue analysis of the Phase I sensor data to identify more obscure process quality data, and develop process maps that correlate sensor output to part microstructure.  Then MLPC and AFIT will design and build the low-cost sensor system to track all key data, and test it on MLPCs custom build additive manufacturing test cell.  Next MLPC will perform the necessary programming and data processing to implement a process monitoring system that will show sensor data position on the process maps in real-time, thus enabling in-process quality assurance.  MLPC will then study and report the cost savings NASA could gain with this technology.  Finally, MLPC will test this concept on an electron beam system and determine its viability for that process.  At the end of Phase II the TRL will be 5, and this product will be ready for licensing for commercial use in existing additive manufacturing machines, and the MLPC developed additive manufacturing system will be available for licensing as a package unit with the integrated sensor system.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA
"1167","Night Rover Challenge","The objective of the Night Rover Challenge was to foster innovations in energy storage technology. Specifically, this challenge asked competitors to create an energy storage system that could provide the power required for a lunar rover to remain continuously operational throughout at least two lunar cycles.  No competitors registered for the challenge competition and the challenge was withdrawn.Solar energy is a renewable source that would be available on the Moon and at other destinations in space. To enable practical system demonstrations of diverse design solutions by independent teams, Phase I of this Challenge will be conducted in an ambient Earth environment. Phase II will entail testing energy storage systems in NASA thermal and thermal-vacuum chambers to demonstrate applicability to the space and lunar environment. The Phase I Challenge will be to demonstrate a portable energy storage system through two cycles of lunar daylight and darkness. Phase II will be for one lunar cycle. During the daylight period, systems will receive electrical energy from a simulated solar collector. During darkness, the stored energy will be used for simulated thermal management, scientific experimentation, communications, and rover movement. The competitors may store and extract the energy by any means they desire. A winning system must exceed the performance of a reference state-of-the-art system by a specified margin. The winning system would be the one that has the highest energy storage density. The available prize purse is $1.5 million. Completing this Challenge could enable: development of mobile systems to collect solar energy, store that energy, and later use it productively; innovations in energy storage technology for space operations and, in particular, to meet the demands imposed by the daylight/darkness cycle on the Moon; and dual-use energy system innovations to benefit terrestrial applications, including vehicles and renewable energy generation systems.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA
"1168","Spacecraft Cabin Air CO2 Recovery, Phase I","An advanced Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) for long duration manned space missions ?such as planetary flight missions or planetary bases- requires an almost complete closure of all relevant material loops.  Energy efficient carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and reduction systems are critical to reducing the power consumption of the spacecraft atmosphere revitalization systems.TDA proposes to develop a rapidly cycling vacuum-assisted thermal swing adsorption (VTSA) system to remove CO2 from cabin air and concentrate it for subsequent reduction and pressurization.  Our unique sorbent exhibits one of the highest capacities reported for CO2 adsorption at very low CO2 partial pressures (1-3 torr CO2 partial pressure range).  The low heat of adsorption of CO2 on the sorbent and the relatively low heat input needed to desorb the CO2 across a small temperature differential during regeneration will reduce the power requirement for the process.  The new material is also highly tolerant to moisture.In Phase I, we will prepare the sorbent and demonstrate its ability in selectively removing CO2 from air under representative conditions.  The technology readiness level (TRL) will be elevated to 3 at the end of Phase I.  We will also complete the detailed design of the VTSA reactor.  In Phase II, we will build a high fidelity prototype assembly and demonstrate the concept at full-scale, elevating the TRL to 5.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA
"1169","Embedding Procedure Assistance into Mission Control Tools, Phase II","Procedures are the accepted means of commanding spacecraft. Proceduresencode the operational knowledge of a system as derived from systemexperts, testing, training and experience.  In current Space Shuttle and ISS operations procedures are displayed using applications separate from the applications used to display commands and telemetry.  This means that procedures cannot interact with commands and telemetry to help an operator's situation awareness.  This leads to slower procedure performance and greater opportunity for errors.  TRACLabs is building on existing NASA Constellation program technology to combine procedures, commanding and telemetry into a single, consistent framework in which to operate space vehicles.   Instead of viewing procedures in static displays, flight controllers will have interactive, reconfigurable procedure displays and assistants that can be tailored for specific situations.  The displays will have different views tailored to specific operations, including browsing, assigning, editing, executing and monitoring procedures.  A procedure executive automates some procedure execution and provides procedure assistance.  Automation is always under the control of the flight controller via level of automation feature.  Each step or instruction of a procedure can be labeled as manual, automated or consent. This will increase the efficiency of procedure performance and reduce procedure errors.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

"1184","Cost Reduction of IMM Solar Cells by Recycling Substrates Using Wet Chemical Etching, Phase II","The goal of the program is to reduce the cost of substrate reclaim for high-efficiency solar cells fabricated by an epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process, and to increase the number of reuse cycles for a given substrate.  If successful, this will result in a reduction in the cost of GaAs-based multi-junction solar cells, in which the cost of the substrate accounts for approximately 50% of the total cost.  The cost reduction is achieved by introducing a new multi-layer etch-stop structure into a inverted metamorphic (IMM) triple-junction cell.  The etch-stop structure is grown between the original GaAs substrate and the ELO release layer, thereby becoming the effective substrate surface after the ELO process.  The etch-stop structure prevents pits and surface damage that occur during ELO from damaging the surface of the GaAs substrate.  The standard method of reclaiming the GaAs substrate after ELO is to employ chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the defect-ridden GaAs surface and chemically polish the underlying GaAs to yield a surface that is suitable for epitaxial growth.  The CMP process works but reduces the substrate thickness and causes minor wafer damage itself, which requires further polishing.  These factors accumulate, in practice limiting the number of reclaim cycles to 5 - 10 for a given substrate.  With the incorporation of the proposed etch-stop structure, the defects are isolated in the etch-stop structure, which can be dissolved by successive selective wet chemical etches to produce the original pristine GaAs surface on a substrate of the original thickness.  All mechanical polishing is eliminated in this proposed work, ensuring a constant substrate thickness through repeated substrate reclaim cycles and reducing the estimated cost of the recycling process to <$1 per substrate.  The Phase I program demonstrated that this method for substrate reclaim works; in Phase II we will develop the reclaim into an optimized batch process.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

The fluid management system will provide the required fluid distribution in the tank, and suppress the formation of large gas bubbles. We will use a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis tool ANSYS FLUENT® to analyze and optimize the performance of the fluid management system.In addition to the work above, the tank materials will be selected based on the thermal performance. The radiation test for these materials will be carried out at NASA Center for Radiation Engineering and Science for Space Exploration (CRESSE).This FY 2014 IRAD study will increase the CHRS TRL level to 2. The design will prove the concept and increase the feasibility of the CHRS system.  The output from this study can be used to pursue research opportunities for the radiation shielding at NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP). JustificationHuman susceptibility to the harsh space radiation environment has been identified as being a major hurdle for exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). High energy protons and nuclei ions from Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) can result in radiation doses that are dangerous to astronaut health and even survivability if the astronauts are not adequately shielded. The high energy particles also cause significant amounts of secondary radiation when they impinge on Aluminum, which is commonly used for spacecraft structure. The secondary neutron radiation may cause human radiogenic cancers. Hydrogen or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because of hydrogen does not easily break down to form secondary radiation source.A  CHRS concept study was conducted by the Cryogenics and Fluids Branch in FY08. The results showed the most mass effective material for protecting a spacecraft if proper design is implemented. The performance of three candidate materials was studied in a LaRC study.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"1189","Mixed-Phase Ice Crystal and Droplet Characterization and Thermometry, Phase I","This effort proposes to design, build, and demonstrate a new instrument for icing research and flight safety capable of discriminating liquid water from ice while simultaneously measuring the diameter, velocity, and temperature of droplets or the velocity and size for ice crystals. From these individual particle characteristics the total liquid water content (LWC) and the total water content (TWC) of the flow may be found. This non-intrusive, laser-based, point measurement diagnostic will operate in an off-axis, backscatter configuration at a range of working distances appropriate to characterize laboratory-scale experiments, icing tunnel flows, free jet test facilities, or flight conditions at altitude.The proposed instrument will apply phase-Doppler interferometry, polarization ratio phase discrimination, droplet rainbow thermometry, and cross-polarization imaging to each particle measured. This will provide joint measures of liquid/solid phase, velocity, diameter or particle size, and droplet temperature. Furthermore, there is redundancy built into the measurements. For instance, the droplet diameter can be measured both by phase-Doppler interferometry and by rainbow thermometry and all four measurement techniques can discriminate solid ice from liquid droplets. While no single instrument can measure all possible cloud droplets, the proposed instrument can be configured to measure droplets from as small as 3 um to larger than 3 mm in diameter.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA
"1190","Impact of Local Environments on the Functional Potential of RNA","RNA world theories figure prominently in many scenarios for the origin and early evolution of life. These theories posit that RNA molecules played a much larger role in ancient biology than they do now, acting both as the dominant biocatalysts and as the repository of genetic information. Strong support for an RNA world is found in the functional capabilities of RNA exhibited by modern biology. Additional support for an RNA world is found in the diversity of functions that have been demonstrated independent of biology using in vitro evolution. In vitro evolution has identified RNA molecules that bind diverse molecular targets (aptamers) and RNAs that catalyze multiple reactions (ribozymes) including phosphoryl-transfer, redox reactions, and carbon-carbon bond formation. The RNA functions exhibited by modern biology and those discovered independent of biology through in vitro evolution have been used to developed and constrain RNA world theories; however, the conditions under which these experiments have been conducted is relatively narrow when compared the range of conditions under which life may have emerged. The range of conditions under which random sequence space has been probed for functional RNAs is far narrower than the range of conditions under which RNA is functional in extant biology, or is presumed to have been functional in the very earliest forms of life. To better understand the impact of the local environment on functional capacity and evolution of RNA, we will evolved several populations of catalytic RNAs staring from random sequences. These RNA populations will be evolved in a variety of different environments in vitro. Evaluating these populations will allow us to understand the impact of the local environment on RNA's functional potential ,what roles RNA could have played in the origin of life, and what conditions are most favorable to RNA catalysis.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

This dataset contains estimates of ocean bottom pressure derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission measurements, produced by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  The data are in spherical harmonics averaged over approximately a month.  The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field variations.  This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 500 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 200 km apart, using a microwave ranging system.  In addition to these range change, the non-gravitional forces are measured on each satellite using a high accuracy electrostatic, room-temperature accelerometer.  The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using twin star cameras and a GPS receiver, respectively.  Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field affect the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently.  These differences are manifested as changes in the distance between the spacecraft, as they orbit the Earth.  This change in distance is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft.  The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals.  The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements.  This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the parameters of an Earth gravity field model.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/JPL/PODAAC","earth-science                        gravity-gravitation...                        solid-earth","public",NA

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm).  Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.Copernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI aerosol layer height algorithm applies a forward model, which includes DISAMAR (Determining Instrument Specifications and Analyzing Methods for Atmospheric Retrieval, a Layer-Based Orders of Scattering algorithm) to calculate monochromatic reflectance, and also employs a neural network scheme for speedy processor performance. Data retrieval uses the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM) for spectral fitting with various aerosol layer pressures and aerosol optical thicknesses in the Oxygen-A band (758 -770nm). The aerosol baseline model assumes a single uniformly distributed aerosol layer with a fixed pressure thickness and a constant aerosol volume extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo. The aerosol parameterization is particularly suitable for elevated non-scattering aerosols such as volcanic ash, desert dust and biomass burning plume.

This data set was produced from the input census units which were used to create a raster surface where pixels that cover the same census data source (most often a country or territory) have the same value. Note that these data are not official representations of country boundaries; rather, they represent the area covered by the input data. In cases where multiple countries overlapped a given pixel (e.g. on national borders), the pixels were assigned the country code of the input data set which made up the majority of the land area. The data file was produced as a global raster at 30 arc-second (~1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions. Each level of aggregation results in the loss of one or more countries with areas smaller than the cell size of the final raster.

"1196","Detectors for Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation","Inflation theory predicts gravity waves in the early universe. These gravity waves are caused by tensor fluctuations, which we expect to have left an imprint in the form of B-mode polarization anisotropies in the CMB. Detecting this polarization is key to confirming and constraining inflation theory as well as a number of cosmological parameters. However, it is very challenging to make such a measurement because the tensor to scalar ratio is expected to be small, especially at large angular scales. In order to achieve the required sensitivity, a new generation of instruments with low-noise, high pixel-count arrays is required. One such instrument is the Q&U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC), a novel ground-based telescope planned for deployment at the Concordia station in Antarctica in 2013. QUBIC will also forge a technological path for a future space-based mission such as CMBPol. I propose to develop a detector array optimized for the QUBIC instrument. There are two types of detectors that we believe are the most promising candidates: transition edge sensors (TESs) and microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), each having advantages and disadvantages in relation to the QUBIC goals. As the current standard for CMB detector arrays, TESs are an extremely well-understood and thoroughly field-tested technology. Though often regarded as photon noise-limited devices, careful calculation reveals that under reasonable QUBIC conditions, we can expect the total NEP (photon+ thermal noise added in quadrature) to be ~ 70% greater than the photon NEP limit. Though TESs have the advantage of being highly sensitive and well-understood, they have a few notable disadvantages in terms of their applicability to the QUBIC telescope. Thermal isolation requirements demand micromachined membranes, which significantly increase fabrication complexity and limit focal plane coverage. Additionally, as arrays push into the multi-thousands of pixels in an effort to achieve the sensitivity needed to detect or rule out the B-mode anisotropy, the technical complexity of SQUID multiplexing schemes is becoming increasingly daunting. The other main candidate for the QUBIC detector array is MKIDs. MKIDs have a number of advantages. Most notably, they lend themselves elegantly to passive frequency domain multiplexing, allowing up to ~1000 pixels to be read out with a single transmission line and a single HEMT amplifier. Additionally, since MKIDs do not have the thermal isolation requirements of bolometers, MKIDs can achieve better focal plane coverage. MKIDs do, however, have certain challenges associated with them. There is in addition to the usual photon noise, a contribution resulting from the generation and recombination of quasiparticles known as g-r noise. These noise concerns have so far precluded MKIDs use in CMB measurements. However, I have shown that for reasonable QUBIC conditions a total NEP (photon + g-r noise added in quadrature) of ~20% greater than the photon noise limit can be achieved for an aluminum resonator of reasonable dimensions. This is moderately better than the TESs under equivalent conditions.The key objectives of my proposed research will be to identify which detector technology is best suited for use in QUBIC and to design, fabricate, test and install a 900-element detector array. Fabricating TESs or MKIDs, however, requires a high-level clean room with dedicated equipment for superconducting thin-film deposition to which I do not have access at my home institution. The NSTR Fellowship would allow me to work with scientists at Goddard Space Flight Centers Detector Development Lab or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Microdevices Lab, groups which are currently world leaders in cryogenic detector research and among the few groups worldwide having significant experience with TESs and MKIDs. Their expertise and facilities will be invaluable in the array design and fabrication process.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

"1199","A Breakthrough Propulsion Architecture for Interstellar Precursor Missions","We propose a new power/propulsion architecture to enable missions such as a 12-yr flight time to 500 AU—the distance at which solar gravity lensing can be used to image exoplanets—with a conventional (i.e., New Horizons sized) spacecraft. This architecture would also enable orbiter missions to Pluto with the same sized spacecraft in just 3.6 years. Significantly, this same architecture could deliver an 80-metric-ton payload to Jupiter orbit in one year, opening the possibility of human missions to Jupiter. These are just a few examples of high-impact missions that simply cannot be performed today due to limitations in current technology. Our architecture accomplishes this by combining the following three innovations:A 10-km diameter, 100-MW laser array that beams power across the solar system.A 70% efficient photovoltaic array tuned to the laser frequency producing power at 12 kV.A 70-MW direct-drive, lithium (not xenon)-based ion propulsion system with a specific impulse of 58,000 s.The key to the development of any system for rapid space transportation is the ability to process a lot of power level with little dry mass, combined with the ability to provide a very high total spacecraft velocity change (delta-V) without a lot of propellant. These two requirements translate into the need for a very low specific mass (kg/kW) and a very high specific impulse. A specific mass of 0.25 kg/kW is enabled in our architecture by removing the power source and most of the power conversion hardware from the spacecraft and replacing them with a lightweight, photovoltaic array that outputs electric power at the voltage needed to drive a lithium-fueled, gridded ion thruster system at a specific impulse of 58,000 s. For comparison, the state-of-the-art for specific mass and specific impulse, as represented by the Dawn spacecraft, are 300 kg/kW and 3,000 s, respectively.This architecture provides a breakthrough way to take advantage of very high-power lasers, of the type described by Lubin, to provide fast transportation though out the solar system and beyond for conventionally-sized spacecraft. We take as a given the existence the “Orbital filled 10-km array” from, and assume that its output power has been derated by a factor of a thousand from 100 GW down to 100 MW. Our innovation is the recognition that such an array increases the power density of photons available to a spacecraft illuminated by the laser beam by two orders of magnitude relative to solar insolation at all the solar system distances beyond 5 AU, and that this enormous power can then be used to great effect by driving a highly-advanced ion propulsion system.A high-voltage photovoltaic array tuned to the laser frequency converts the laser power to electric power at an efficiency of 70% and produces an output voltage of 12 kV. The 12-kV output voltage is used directly to provide the net accelerating voltage for the lithium fueled, gridded ion propulsion system eliminating the heavy, inefficient, power processing hardware, and the associated thermal radiators, typically needed to drive ion propulsion systems. The lithium-fueled, gridded ion propulsion system provides a specific impulse of 58,000 s, roughly 20 times the current state of the art. Lithium stores as a solid, is easily ionized, and very difficult to doubly ionize. This allows the thruster to be operated with nearly 100% ionization of the propellant which effectively eliminates neutral gas leakage from the thruster and the production of charge-exchange ions that are responsible for thruster erosion and current collection on the photovoltaic arrays. This key benefit enables very long thruster life and facilitates the development of the 12-kV photovoltaic array.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"1210","Uncovering effects of climate variables on global vegetation","The objective of this project is to understand the causal relationships of how ecosystem dynamics, mostly characterized by vegetation changes, in different geographical areas with distinct eco-climatic variability, are affected by regulating climatic factors and other anthropogenic disturbances and extreme events. Although this is a well-studied problem, the state-of-the-art in this area has significant room for improvement. For example, climate variables such as precipitation, solar radiation, and temperature have traditionally been studied as limiting factors affecting plant vegetation growth. However, a quantitative analysis of the influence of unknown or unexpected driving forces on vegetation anomalies is still missing in the context of abrupt climate change (e.g. persistent drought, heat waves) and human-induced local events (e.g. forest fire, irrigation). Similarly, most prior studies have based their analyses on assumptions of linearity and certain types of nonlinearity in the dependency relationships between observed/modeled climate variables and satellite-derived vegetation indices. We hypothesize that such assumptions may not hold true in practice when scaled over large regions, thereby rendering the non-generalized models and the understanding of ecosystem dynamics potentially misconstrued. In this study we propose to use a regression technique called 'symbolic regression' for learning these complex time-space relationships and their evolution over time. This genetic programming based learning technique has demonstrated the potential of discovering new dependency structures among variables that were previously unknown. Using symbolic regression, we not only expect to uncover new relationships among well-studied climate variables, but also identify latent factors responsible for vegetation anomalies. We will use NASA's high-end computing and data infrastructure at the NASA Earth Exchange facility in order to scale this evolutionary optimization based regression technique to build global prediction frameworks using hierarchical and ensemble approaches. The benefits of this work will be in improving the understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and generalizing those understandings from regional to global scales. The work will leverage the results of previous NASA-funded efforts, both in terms of data sets and computing infrastructure. The work will aim to answer three science questions starting at the local level and then moving to a global scale. They are:  1) what is the magnitude and extent of ecosystem exposure, sensitivity and resilience to the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts, 2) what are the human-induced and other attribution factors that cause vegetation anomalies in certain geographical regions that cannot be otherwise explained by the natural climate variability, and, 3) how does the learned dependency of vegetation on the climate variables and other exogenous factors vary across different eco-climatic zones and geographical regions on a global scale? This project will develop algorithms that will answer the three questions listed above with the help of the domain scientist's validation. This modeling exercise based on symbolic regression is the first of its kind for earth science applications. Therefore, entry TRL of the project is 2. On successful completion of milestones, the exit level TRL is expected to be 4, where the capabilities have been validated at a global scale. The interdisciplinary team includes expertise in large-scale data mining, symbolic regression, evolutionary optimization, and Earth science, to meet the technical challenges of this project.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        nasa-headquarters",NA,NA

The goal is to find a low-cost way of building a telescope for hard X-rays with a very large effective area.  The project is to build a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E>20 keV) using a “scotch-tape” design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. Key challenges are (a) to find a suitably smooth tape substrate (this has been done), (b) to wind a large number of tape shells onto the smooth metal centerpiece without introducing and accumulating shape irregularities, and (c) to give the tape the variable thickness profile in order to achieve the desired optical figure. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the idea feasibility by building a crude conical X-ray concentrator. If successful, we will aim at building and flying a mirror prototype on a balloon and then proposing for an Explorer mission or MOO.

Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5.The 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) + MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-water-v...                        earth-science                        precipitation","public",NA
"1217","Lipid Biomarkers of the Deep Subsurface Biosphere","Microbial life on Earth is pervasive, inhabiting even the most extreme surface environments and extending deep into the subsurface. Because of the limited impact of any individual microbe, much of what is known about microbial activity in the environment has been inferred from chemical changes, phylogenetic similarity to lab organisms, or proxy records. It is now firmly established that microbial processes drive many geochemical cycles on Earth, but little is known about the activity and impact of the deep subsurface biosphere on these processes.A number of approaches have been used to investigate the subsurface biosphere including chemical profiling, DNA and RNA sequencing, and, in a limited number of settings, lipid biomarkers. Lipids are ubiquitous in biology, deriving from the cellular membrane, and have the potential to be preserved for billions of years in sedimentary environments. Lipid biomarkers are used as proxy records for the presence and activity of particular microbes, and have yielded rich records of microbial activity in modern and ancient environments. For this reason, the search for life beyond the Earth includes the search for extraterrestrial lipid biomarkers. However, biomarker proxies require calibration to the environment of interest, and thus we must first ask what sort of biomarker patterns (both structural and isotopic) might be expected in the Martian or Europan subsurface. Characterization of the biomarker profiles of in situ microbes from the terrestrial subsurface (an analog environment to extraterrestrial targets) will significantly advance the application of these powerful tools.In this proposal we present a plan for detailed investigation of the lipid biomarkers present in the deep continental subsurface. A single lipid contains multiple layers of information useful for biogeochemical interpretation, including the polar head group (for living microbes), the structure of the hydrocarbon skeleton (both living and fossil), and the isotopic composition of the hydrocarbon core (both living and fossil). We will analyze all three of these components from a range of terrestrial locations with the aim of identifying signatures common to the subsurface. Furthermore, we will apply the same methods to isolated subsurface organisms to 1) advance understanding of the biological controls in biomarkers patterns and 2) serve as calibration points for our environmental investigations. A unique partnership between this proposal and the NAI Life Underground will provide access to samples, geochemical data, molecular data, and isolated subsurface organisms well beyond what would be possible alone.The methodology used in this study is established in the community and available in the laboratories of the principle investigator and collaborators. Measurements of intact polar lipids will be made by via high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Measurements of core lipids for structural and isotopic composition will be preformed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in the laboratory of PI Osburn.This proposal will directly advance goals of the NASA astrobiology roadmap (NAR) and ROSES 2014 Exobiology NRA. Characterizing the biomarker fingerprint of the deep subsurface biosphere is a critical first step towards understanding signatures from extraterrestrial targets, directly related to NAR Goal 7, Determine how to recognize signatures of life on other worlds and on early Earth. Furthermore, the NRA research emphasis, Biosignatures and Life Elsewhere specifically solicits for biosignature studies of analog environments, in this case, the deep continental subsurface. In addition, the environmental extremes present in the deep subsurface are drivers of adaptation and evolution thus study of these systems directly addresses NAR Goal 5, Objective 5.3 – Biochemical adaptation to extreme environments and NRA research emphasis, Early Evolution of Life and the Biosphere.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

THIS INSTRUMENT MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARGED PARTICLES (>26 KEV ELECTRONS AND >30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CALIBRATED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAGED TO ABOUT 15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXACT BEGINNING AND ENDING TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF THE MEDIUM ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. FOR THIS BROWSE DATA SET ONLY SCAN AVERAGE DATA IS GIVEN (NO ANGULAR INFORMATION). THE DATA IS IN THE FORM OF 'RATE' DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO THE USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION WOULD DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMINATIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES OF THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES AND BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE STUDY OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT 'RATE' TO 'INTENSITY' FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND CONTAMINATION AND SUBTRACT THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL. BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2) DIVIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC FACTOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANDPASS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC FACTOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY 'channel_geometric_ factor' AS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL 'channel_id'. TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY BANDPASS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'FPLECPENERGY', AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM 'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES WITH THE DESIGNATIONS 'CH' THESE BANDPASSES CAN BE USED ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE ACCEPTED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'FPLECPCHANZ', WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM 'Z' VALUE ACCEPTED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANDPASS REFERS ONLY TO THE LOWEST 'Z' VALUE ACCEPTED. THE BANDPASSES FOR OTHER 'Z' VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT TO SERIOUS CONTAMINATIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMINATIONS CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMINATION TYPES ('contamination_id' , 'contamination_desc') AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION ('data_quality_id' CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS 'data_quality_desc') BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY.

"1220","Efficient Quantification of Uncertainties in Complex Computer Code Results, Phase II","Propagation of parameter uncertainties through large computer models can be very resource intensive. Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The Reduced-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (ROCUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The ROCUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (Latin Hypercube Sampling -- LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. ROCUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as ROCUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the Phase II project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of ROCUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

Furthermore, these novel modeling and design tools willprovide a means of integrating disparate models, allow agile evolutionof models, and encourage MBD reporting mechanisms be used in reviews.Ultimately, these MBD tools will enable lower-cost system developmentand cost versus lifetime assessment, shorten development time, andextend flight-proven technology to broader applications.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"1231","Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) Data from the Lunar Lake 2001 Campaign","The AIRMISR_LUNAR_LAKE_2001 data were acquired during a flight over Lunar Lake, Nevada on June 30, 2001. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aft For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2).","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC","earth-science                        infrared-wavelengths                        spectral-engineering                        visible-wavelengths","public",NA

The first product contains the actual depth values (in meters) of the interpolated continuous surface saved as real numbers in both ENVI and GeoTIFF formats. Also available is a color scaled depth GeoTIFF image which has an embedded color scale bar. This secondary file is meant only for viewing but has the unique advantage of being a GeoTIFF file. Therefore, this map can be a background image with other projected files of interest in the area. Data provided in this data set were used to develop a methodology for processing and applying high resolution bathymetric data acquired with a Lowrance-480M ecosounder in the Amazon floodplain. This research was supported by the addition of Landast/TM images for planning and executing the survey. 4600 km of transects were processed semi-automatically and integrated into a georeferenced database. A digital elevation model with 15 m horizontal resolution and 1 cm vertical resolution was generated for the floodplain. The changes in inundated area and volume of water on the floodplain were estimated. Regression models were constructed to predict flood area and water stored volume from water level. The results of this research show that water level and flooded area mapped from images are good enough for estimating water stored volume in the Lago Grande de Curuai (Barbosa et al., 2006).","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","earth-science                        surface-water                        terrestrial-hydrosp...","public",NA
"1233","Wire-line Analysis Tool for Subsurface Observations of Northern-ice-sheets: The WATSON Project","The windows to the terrestrial historical climate record can be accessed through analysis of ice cores from polar ice sheets such as those found in Greenland. Surface processes such desertification, volcanic activity, and meteoritic impacts can be observed in the dust particles trapped in ice layers. Similarly the polar ice caps on Mars offer a means to survey the climate and, through the analysis of organics and minerals preserved in the ice, the habitability of the planet. The overarching goals are to use an in-situ organic/mineral spectrometer integrated into a ice borehole drilling system to address two science questions associated to microbial and organic distribution and persistence in subsurface ice sheets as well as two science mission operations goals. To achieve these goals the proposed effort will include laboratory analysis in coordination with the National Ice Core Labs (NICL) and field deployments to the Fremont Glacier and Greenland to drilling new 100m boreholes for in-situ analysis.As part of this program a TRL 5 deep UV fluorescence/Raman imaging instrument that spatially maps the distribution of organics, microbes, minerals, and anions, on surfaces and in ice, will be integrated into an existing wire-line drilling system. This integration will require only minor modification that will occur in year 1.The integrated system will address the following science questions under this program: 1) What can the organic and microbial micro-scale spatial distributions within ice tell us about past climate and habitability?  Do these features remain localized within the initial dust accumulation zone or migrate across zones through ice veins? This requires access to both currently available cores as well in-situ measurements to assess what effects are associated to contamination and/or a result of ice core volume relaxation (removal from hydrostatic pressures). 2) What is the effect of the radiation environment on the preservation potential of organic and microbial densities? Our analyses of subsurface ice formed in high altitude, high UV environments (Fremont Glacier — Wyoming) will be compared to data collected on Greenland ice (near GISP2). In addition to advancing the understanding of microbial and organic distributions in terrestrial ice sheets, these science investigations will lead to an understanding of the organic/microbial related features may be preserved in the subsurface ice of Mars polar caps and how they would be distributed in the presence of biogenic activity.In addition to the science investigations, the proposal will include science mission operations and will incorporate autonomy enable drilling and in-situ analysis. This is a necessary requirement for terrestrial ice analysis and for planetary ice analysis where rapid analysis is required to avoid potential closing of ice borehole. The autonomy leverages both prior drilling programs as well as deep UV instrument development under NSF, NASA, and DoD.  The operations will demonstrate 1) achieving the science goals in-situ, without the complexity of sample handling and sample processing of core extraction or manipulation and 2) acquisition of multiple ice boreholes will be used to demonstrate the effect of site selection and variability in science return. These results will be used to better understand the formulation of a future Mars polar mission that accesses the subsurface ice.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

"1236","Miniature High Force, Long Stroke Linear Shape Memory Alloy Actuators, Phase II","Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are metal alloys (of Nickel-Titanium, for example) that can change their shape when heated. When drawn and processed in wire form, the shape change is an aggressive contraction, with useable lifetimes of millions of cycles. Despite this fact, SMAs have largely been a scientific curiosity, finding very little commercial use as actuators since their discovery over 30 years ago. The apparent lack of practical application may be attributable to their low recoverable strain (~4% of total wire length). MIGA Motor Company has numerous international patents covering Displacement Multiplication (DM) techniques that allow us to package large strokes in highly compact, lightweight packages. Our current commercially available electric linear actuators provide 1/2"" of stroke with 4.5 pounds of output force. We propose to develop several high force variants of our DM designs, allowing up to 32 lbf (high cycle count) or 48 lbf (hundreds of cycles) in a device weighing less than 2 ounces. The manufacturing techniques that we have developed in manufacturing the DM actuators have paved the way to expansion into the high force realm: high reliability wire attachment methods, use of high temperature thermoplastics, protected or over-molded precision chemically-etched stainless-steel stages, and various load-sharing techniques have enabled these powerful actuators to finally become a reality.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

"1241","Consistent Practices for Characterizing the Detection Limits of Fracture Critical Metallic Component Inspection Systems","NASA-STD-5009 requires that successful flaw detection by NDE methods be statistically qualified for use on fracture critical metallic components using Probability of Detection (POD) studies, but does not standardize practices. This task works towards standardizing calculations and record retention with a web-based tool, the NASA POD Standards Library, or NPSL. Best practices for test methods and specimen storage will also be provided with appendices to NASA-STD-5009, which is currently unded revision. Additionally, this appendix will describe how POD specimens used to qualify NDE systems will be cataloged, stored and protected from corrosion, damage, or loss. BackgroundFlaw detection capability is established for inspection systems on the basis of Probability of Detection (POD).  The commonly accepted metric for an adequate inspection system is as follows: for a minimum flaw size which is smaller than the critical defect being sought, there is 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence (90/95 POD).  Inspection systems that are incapable of meeting the 90/95 POD requirement at or below the critical defect level for fracture critical components are deemed unsuitable for that inspection.  To provide an efficient and accurate methodology that yields estimates of POD and confidence bounds for Hit-Miss or signal amplitude testing the directed design of experiments for probability of detection (DOEPOD) method has been developed.  In DOEPOD, signal amplitudes are reduced to Hit-Miss data by defining a signal threshold.  The directed DOEPOD method uses a nonparametric approach for the analysis of inspection data which, unlike other methods, does not rely on simlifying assumptions regarding the general form of a POD function.  This differs with other methods that define a POD curve based on a curve fit and does not assume increasing detection with increasing flaw sizes that can often be proven untrue.  For a given sample set, the DOEPOD procedure identifies whether the minimum requirement of 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence is demonstrated for a minimum flaw size and for all greater flaw sizes (90/95 POD).  These procedures are sequentially executed to minimize the number of samples needed to demonstrate that there is a 90/95 POD lower confidence bound at a given flaw size and that the POD is monotonic for flaw sizes exceeding that 90/95 POD flaw size.This work provides strong experimental and simulation evidence that a 90/95 POD flaw size will be identified by DOEPOD 95% of the time if it exists, and the procedures will yield a determination that the POD is non-monotonic 97% of the time when it is non-monotonic.  Based on this evidence, the DOEPOD methodology may be used to reduce mission risk by quantifiably meeting the requirements of NASA-STD-5009, “Nondestructive Evaluation Requirements for Fracture Critical Metallic Components.” ApproachA total of 860 metal specimens have been produced with a selection of fatigue cracks, fastener hole cracks, lack of weld fusion, and electrical discharge machined (EDM) flaws.  The metals used in this study are common throughout aerospace, and include aluminum, titanium, nickel-chromium alloy, and stainless steel.  Flat plates and tubes with programmed defects are being examined.  These specimens are being examined with x-ray radiography with differing film densities, digital radiography, ultrasound (including phased array), eddy current (including automated methods), florescent penetrant testing (L3 & L4), magnetic particle testing, and visual testing.  CustomersAll NASA centers and missions utilizing failure critical components. Products</p","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        white-sands-test-fa...",NA,NA
"1242","Electronics Modernization","There is a need to reduce mass and volume on any spacecraft whether for earth orbit insertion or travel within the solar system. Less mass and a smaller volume can dramatically reduce the cost of the launch vehicle as well as the spacecraft. Subsequently, the problem of too much mass and volume can be a result of the spacecraft structure, propulsion system, instrument and its electronics. This Workshop will focus on mass and volume reduction of the electronics.Current electronic packaging designs used in our most recent spacecraft are comprised of technologies from the 1980's and 1990's. The current approach to electronic packaging design and selection uses well known design solutions because they are considered low risk and have space flight heritage; typically a ruggedized VME (Versatile Mechanical Euro) packaging architectures. Semiconductor features of this vintage utilize features that are measured in microns. As semiconductors have advanced, features are now measured in nanometers. We can use the example of the iPhone; with our current electronics design approaches the iPhone would be the size of a breadbox. These modern phones and devices such as laptop computers incorporate hundreds of new packaging technologies, some of which are appropriate for spaceflight and some that are not robust enough. The challenge is to identify the most useful technologies that are likely to survive rigorous spacecraft testing. With the exception of some earth-orbiting missions, virtually all other missions have unique environmental survival requirements. The primary objective of the Workshop will be to identify industry established state-of-the-art packaging technologies that can be leveraged without technology development with a focus on miniaturization. This will include active and passive components, substrates, connectors etc. Reliability and reworkability will be considered but will be a secondary objective in order to allow creativity. There will be a review of current JPL electronic packaging subsystems that can be exploited by reverse engineering the existing design. Also, new in-process JPL designs will be considered for redesign.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

The objective of Phase II is to raise the TRL by comprehensive development/improvement of the prototype system, extensive performance evaluation, and close collaboration with Pratt & Whitney for technology transition. The success of this program will bring significant benefits to the propulsion industry by providing a cutting-edge engine diagnostics system with features that have never been available, including adaptive nonlinear engine model, adaptive threshold, transferrable-belief-model-based residual evaluation within a unified framework. These novel technologies will greatly improve performance of onboard engine diagnostics system especially during transient operations and further reduce false alarm rate and missed detection rate, resulting in improved flight safety and significant reduction in overall engine maintenance cost.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

A SiC/SiC CMC airfoil section will be bonded to a single crystal superalloy root section in order to mitigate risks associated with an all-CMC blade inserted in a superalloy disk.   This allows current blade attachment technology (SX blade with a dovetail attachment to a slotted Ni disk) to be used with a ceramic airfoil.  The bond between the CMC and single crystal will be primarily mechanical in nature, and enhanced with clamping arising from thermal expansion mismatch.  Two single crystal root sections will be bonded to each other using diffusion bonding and/or transient liquid phase bonding at temperatures near 2200 0F.  The single crystals will form a clam shell around the CMC, with little or no gap between the metal and ceramic.  Upon cooling, the metal will shrink around the CMC spar to firmly clamp it. Single crystals will resist stress relaxation at an operating temperature of 1500 0F, thus maintaining clamping loads for long lives.  The use of an inter layer (""compliant layer"") between the CMC and the single crystal may also be entertained.   1500 0F is a reasonable upper limit for chemical reactivity issues between the metal and ceramic.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

Level 3 standard mapped image products contain gridded 1 degree spatial resolution salinity and wind speed data averaged over 7 day and monthly time scales.  This particular dataset is the 7-Day running mean sea surface salinity (SSS) V5.0 Aquarius CAP product.  CAP is a P.I. produced dataset developed and provided by JPL.  The CAP algorithm utilizes data from both the onboard radiometer and scatterometer to simultaneously retrieve salinity, wind speed and direction by minimizing the sum of squared differences between model and observations. The main improvements in CAP V5.0 relative to the previous version include: updates to the Geophysical Model Functions to 4th order harmonics with the inclusion of sea surface temperature (SST) and stability at air-sea interface effects; use of the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) SST product as the new source ancillary sea surface temperature data in place of NOAA OI SST.   The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit.  Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km.

"1252","Meteorology and soil temperatures, Hot Weather Creek, Ellesmere Island, NWT, Canada, Version 1","The instrumentation was installed in June 1988 and was initially maintained by the Arctic Adaptation Division Canadian Climate Centre, Atmospheric Environment Service (CCC/AES) with field support by Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). It consists of a Campbell Scientific CR10 micrologger with meteorological sensors for air temperature an relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar incoming radiation. It also supports a snow depth sensor, an experimental vegetation temperature and four ground temperatures. It is powered by a 25-AH, 12-volt gel cell (a second gel cell was added in 1989) charged by a 10-watt solar panel. Hourly and Daily sampling was carried out. Data have been quality controlled and fully documented (see documentation files accompanying the data). The High Arctic Integrated Research and Monitoring Area (IRMA) of the GSC was established on Fosheim Peninsula to support interdisciplinary studies related to environmental change. Research carried out between 1989 and 1994, had as primary objective to determine relationships between geomorphic processes and climate in order to help predict the potential geologic impact of global change. Establishment of detailed paleoclimatic records for this region has also been considered essential to provide a context for ongoing climate change. Paleoecological studies (records of peat cores, lakes cores, ice cores, sea cores and archeological records) in concert with other methodologies have been used to outline climatic variability (short, middle or long-term variabilities) and are a primary research component in the region. A major compilation of 20 papers has been produced (see Garneau in press) involving 34 participants from government, universities and industry. The synthesis includes the results from studies of modern conditions (climate, flora and fauna), quaternary geology and glacial history, paleoenvironmental records (i.e. ice cores, ocean, lakes, peat, archeological sites), permafrost dynamics and hydrologic systems. Nine appendices complete the document including a comprehensive bibliography and various data series (climate, vegetation, insects, geophysics, plant and arthropod macrofossils and radiocarbon dates) to provide background forfuture projects in the area.

"1255","Lunar Organic Waste Reformer, Phase I","The Lunar Organic Waste Reformer (LOWR) utilizes high temperature steam reformation to convert all plastic, paper, and human waste materials into useful gases. In the LOWR, solar thermal concentrators are used to heat steam directly to 900 C, after which the steam is injected into a reactor which is being fed with waste materials via a lock hopper. At the high temperatures, the steam will react with all organic materials to produce a gas mixture largely composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with small fractions of methane and CO. After removing the remaining steam from the product stream via condensation, the gases are dusulfurized and then fed through a polysulfone membrane which separates CO and CH4 in the retentate from CO2 and H2 in the permeate. The retentate CO/CH4 gas stream can be used to reduce regolith, while the CO2/H2 permeate stream is sent to a Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reactor which transforms the CO2/H2 gas into CO and H2O. The CO can then be used for regolith reduction, while the H2O can be used as is, or electrolyzed to make oxygen and hydrogen. With effective recycling of the steam, no consumables are lost in the process. All products are liquids or gases, making the system highly reliable and subject to automation. In the proposed Phase 1 program, Pioneer Astronautics will build on its extensive heritage with development of RWGS and regolith reduction systems developed for Lunar and Mars in-situ propellant production to build and demonstrate a LOWR unit.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA
"1256","Towards a Framework for Evaluating and Comparing Diagnosis Algorithms","Diagnostic inference involves the detection of anomalous system behavior and the identification of its cause, possibly down to a failed unit or to a parameter of a failed unit. Traditional approaches to solving this problem include expert/rule-based, model-based, and data-driven methods. Each approach (and various techniques within each approach) use different representations of the knowledge required to perform the diagnosis. The sensor data is expected to be combined with these internal representations to produce the diagnosis result. In spite of the availability of various diagnosis technologies, there have been only minimal efforts to develop a standardized software framework to run, evaluate, and compare different diagnosis technologies on the same system. This paper presents a framework that defines a standardized representation of the system knowledge, the sensor data, and the form of the diagnosis results – and provides a run-time architecture that can execute diagnosis algorithms, send sensor data to the algorithms at appropriate time steps from a variety of sources (including the actual physical system), and collect resulting diagnoses. We also define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms, and provide software to calculate the metrics.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA
"1257","Aging Methodologies and Prognostic Health Management for Electrolytic Capacitors","Understanding the ageing mechanisms of electronic components critical avionics systems such as the GPS and INAV are of critical importance. Electrolytic capacitors and MOSFET’s have higher failure rates among the components of DC-DC power converter systems. Our current work focuses on analyzing and modeling electrolytic capacitor degradation and its effects on the output of DC-DC converter systems. The output degrada- tion is typically measured by an increase in ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and decrease in the capacitance value over long periods of use even under nominal operating conditions. Typically the primary effect of degradation is increased ripple current and this has adverse effects on downstream components. For example, in avionics systems where the power supply drives a GPS unit, ripple currents can cause glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this may cause errors in the Inertial Navigation (INAV) system, causing the aircraft to fly off course. In this paper, we present the details of our ageing methodology along with details of experiments and analysis of the results.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

AMS data have been critical to much of our understanding of aircraft PM emissions, but in the past it has had limited utility in probing the smallest (<100 nm) particles in the exhaust. Also, prior to this work the AMS has been able to detect only volatile PM and other instruments have been required to characterize the non-volatile (soot). During Phase I, we: 1) developed an improved computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model to simulate the performance of the AMS for <100 particles; 2) used the CFD model to invent a new AMS technology with improved performance for <100 nm particles; and 3) evaluated a newly developed instrument which combines a laser vaporization system with a standard AMS to provide size resolved mass and composition data for soot.  During Phase II we propose: 1) upgrade our CFD modeling capability to three-dimensions to evaluate Brownian motion and the effects of fabrication imperfections; 2) fabricate and test the promising lens geometry invented during Phase I; 3) demonstrate the laser vaporization AMS and improved lens design(s) in the laboratory and in the field.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

"1267","High energy density additives for Hybrid Fuel Rockets to Improve Performance and Enhance Safety","We propose a conceptual study of prototype strained hydrocarbon molecules as high energy density additives for hybrid rocket fuels to boost the performance of these rockets without compromising safety and reliability. Use of these additives could extend the range of applications for which hybrid rockets become an attractive alternative to conventional solid or liquid fuel rockets. The objectives of the study were to confirm and quantify the high enthalpy of these strained molecules and to assess improvement in rocket performance that would be expected if these additives were blended with conventional fuels. We confirmed the chemical properties (including enthalpy) of these additives. However, the predicted improvement in rocket performance was too small to make this a useful strategy for boosting hybrid rocket performance.Hybrid rockets use a solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer. They have advantages over solid fuel rockets for certain space applications because the solid fuel component is more stable than combined solid fuel and oxidizer, and advantages over liquid fuel rockets because the fuel does not require cryogenic storage or pumping and the burn rate can be controlled by regulating the flow of oxidizer. Ideal fuels should a fast regression rate, high density and good mechanical stability (so it will not break apart during burning). A current project at ARC is evaluating hybrid rockets comprised of solid paraffin fuel and cryogenic nitrous oxide and LOX oxidizer and has shown that higher regression rates are needed. Strained cyclic hydrocarbons have positive enthalpy and can be blended with paraffins to make fuels for hybrid rockets, but to be effective the resulting solid must have physical and mechanical characteristics at least comparable to the pure paraffin fuels. The stable hydrocarbon molecules with the highest strain energy are comprised of triangular rings of carbon atoms (cyclopropane), but these are gases at normal temperatures and pressures. Recently, chemists have synthesized molecules (called ivyanes, shown in Figure 1) containing multiple cyclopropane rings bonded together. We propose investigating blends of ivyanes and paraffins to determine their thermochemical and physical properties. We will first carry out simulations to predict enthalpy, density and stability of these blends using first principles chemistry and physics methods. Previously, first principles calculations by two of us (Jaffe and Zehe, J. Organic Chem. 2010, 75, 4387) demonstrated thermochemical properties can be determined to an accuracy of 2 kJ/mol for hydrocarbon molecules containing 10-20 carbon atoms. In the second phase, the density, melting temperature and heat of sublimation of solid ivyanes and the blends will be determined from molecular dynamics simulations.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

This development will build on capabilities demonstrated on other JPL limbed robotic platforms such as the Curiosity Rover, ATHLETE, and RoboSimian. The Underwater Mobile Manipulation robotic system will consist of a perception suite, 7 degree of freedom robotic limb and associated perception and control software. The perception suite includes color stereo cameras in dome-port underwater housings, a 2D imaging sonar, a variable illumination underwater light and a pan-tilt mount. Fused opti-acoustic point clouds will be created from these instruments using JPL stereo vision and sensor fusion techniques and acoustic image processing techniques described in literature. The robotic limb will be adapted from the modular limb design used by RoboSimian. Each joint will employ the same high power-density harmonic geared actuator. Actuator control electronics will reside in the actuator housings. The limb will incorporate a 3 DOF gripper based off of the RoboSimian CAMHand. On both the limb actuators and gripper, traditional o-ring and spring-energized sealing approaches will be used to seal the air-filled housings to 30m depth. To control the limb we will adapt the high DOF motion planning from ATHLETE and RoboSimian which make use of distributed, networked motor control components. Semi-autonomous manipulation behaviors will be developed by parameterizing behaviors to chain together sets of arm motions while monitoring end-effector force measurements.

"1274","JSC Simulations of ADR Technologies","Leveraging efforts begun in FY12, this project has developed a unique hardware-in-the-loop dynamic testing environment for use in a proposed Active Debris Removal Vehicle (ADRV) spacecraft development activity.  This test-bed provides NASA with a dynamic testing environment that allows an increase of roughly two orders of magnitude in relative motion over existing dynamic test facilities for testing a broad range of new sensors and software pertaining to spacecraft rendezvous, proximity operations, and capture. Particular emphasis is placed upon characterization of uncooperative objects, such as orbital debris, although this equipment could be used for a variety of other rendezvous and capture simulations.  It provides an initial operating capability using fully autonomous JSC-developed air bearing hardware, with sensors and GNC, to support this testing, in cooperation with partners from Texas A&M University, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and the Aerospace Corporation.  Provides a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration at JSC of two-body proximity operations using air bearing sleds emulating the ADRV and debris target represented by a Titan 1 upper stage nozzle on loan from the USAF.Orbital debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is an international problem that threatens the success of all future Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space and exploration activities.  Research indicated that removing large debris objects is the best means to reduce the overall hazard from orbital debris, since large debris is the creation engine for smaller, more numerous, fractionation objects. Based on an analysis of alternatives of various remediation methods, this project has implemented a testing environment consistent with the chosen approach, a tug-based method to actively capture and deorbit the debris.  However, this type of mission must consider that large debris bodies are derelict and without active controls, hence unable to hold a consistent attitude.  Worse yet, they are often tumbling at rates of up to 3 revolutions per minute, a rate dramatically higher than prior rendezvous and proximity operations state-of-the-art.  Therefore, methods to test approach and capture methods, as well as sensor and guidance navigation and control concepts, were needed in order to retire the principle risks with this type of mission.  First in three degrees of freedom, and initially at lower rates, the developed testing environment will be used to mature the operational techniques as well as the sensor technologies necessary for this mission to be successful.  As maturity is accumulated, relative rates will be increased, and although out of the initial scope of the project, additional degrees of freedom, up to five and six DOF, will later be incorporated.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA
"1275","Model Predictive Control of an Underdamped, Pneumatically Actuated, Soft Robot with Flexible Links for Unmodeled Environments","Soft robots (made of compliant or soft materials) are often perceived as less capable when compared to traditional rigid robots. However, the proposed work will show that we can have compliant robots that are effective when operating in uncertain conditions while still having precise, high performance control for manipulation and mobility. In order to dramatically improve control for soft robots, we will initially develop optimal control methods on a 14 degree of freedom, pneumatically actuated, fabric-based, light-weight, mechanically robust robot torso and arms.  This system is underactuated and underdamped, and we expect that advances in control for this platform will translate directly to systems with similar dynamics. Furthermore, the resilience of this platform to unmodeled collisions will enable us, as part of our proposed research, to develop algorithms for collaboratively working with other soft robots or people in harsh environments such as space. The platform on which we are developing our algorithms is light-weight, relatively inexpensive, and can be compactly stored for transportation. The result of our proposed work will be a set of control algorithms that will improve the overall performance and relevance of soft robots for future NASA missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","brigham-young-unive...                        completed",NA,NA
"1276","Low Permeation Envelope Material Development for Titan Aerobot, Phase I","Aerobot vehicles for missions on Titan require envelope materials that are strong, light and durable. Unlike terrestrial balloon materials, these must be able to withstand flexing at temperatures of 90K without developing pinhole leaks. To meet this requirement, it is proposed to use Lamart?s experience in lightweight laminated sailcloth and ultra light film lamination to create a material for this application. This will be a laminated combination of multiple thin films and fabric. Test capabilities will be created and correlated to those already done at NASA-JPL. Literature search and sample testing will determine the appropriate film, adhesive, fibers, and fabric weave. Further testing will determine the minimum manageable film thickness and the minimum amount of adhesive needed to meet the mission requirements. Laminations of multiple layers of thin film will be tested to determine the benefit of this schedule compared to single layer equivalent films. Small quantities of the most promising film and fabric laminate designs will be produced on a narrow width laminator that duplicates the process used to produce full sized products and tested for flex durability.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA
"1277","Augmented Reality Telepresence for Robotic Exploration","State of the art virtual reality requires low latency, on the order of single-digit milliseconds to present a scene to an operator using immersive tracking devices. In conventional teleoperation, the operator's movements are used to directly control a remote camera, requiring a fast response time to avoid simulator sickness, an approach not feasible for interplanetary robotic control with limited bandwidth, high latency communications. The proposed work develops a hybrid architecture to present a model of a coarse virtual world to an operator, while the real imagery slowly refines the presentation as bandwidth allows. An online physics engine allows an actuation command in the virtual world to be faithfully executed in the real world without direct operator feedback. The end goal is a smooth, visually realistic operator interface that allows for remote operation of an exploration vehicle in a blended world scene of virtual and actual data.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        university-of-color...",NA,NA

"1279","NASA B200 Aircraft Navigational Data Collected During the First DISCOVER-AQ Project","The overarching objective of the Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) investigation was to improve the interpretation of satellite observations to diagnose near-surface conditions relating to air quality. To diagnose air quality conditions from space, reliable satellite information on aerosols and ozone precursors was needed for specific, highly correlated times and locations to be used in air quality models and compared to surface- and aircraft-based measurements. DISCOVER-AQ provided an integrated dataset of airborne and surface observations relevant to the diagnosis of surface air quality conditions from space. These records pertain to the Maryland mission that took place from 1/10/2013 to 2/8/2013. The NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) is used to characterize clouds and small particles in the atmosphere, called aerosols. From an airborne platform, the HSRL scientist team studies aerosol size, composition, distribution and movement.The HSRL instrument is an innovative technology that is similar to radar; however, with lidar, radio waves are replaced with laser light. Lidar allows researchers to see the vertical dimension of the atmosphere, and the advanced HSRL makes measurements that can even distinguish among different aerosol types and their sources. The HSRL technique takes advantage of the spectral distribution of the lidar return signal to discriminate aerosol and molecular signals and thereby measure aerosol extinction and backscatter independently. It measures aerosol backscatter and depolarization at 532 and 1064 nm and aerosol extinction at 532 nm.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC","air-quality                        atmosphere                        earth-science                        national-geospatial...                        ngda","public",NA

"1283","Sensitivity-Based Simulation Software for Optimization of Turbine Blade Cooling Strategies, Phase I","In recent years, there has been a tendency to use ever-higher gas turbine inlet temperatures, resulting in ever-higher heat loads necessitating efficient cooling. Internal cooling designs have evolved from the use of simple curved ducts in early designs to very complex geometries. Similar complexities govern film cooling as well, leading to complex fluid-structure interactions and turbulence physics. These complexities make it impossible to obtain optimal cooling designs by intuition alone.     In this project we propose to develop optimization software for the design and optimization of turbine blade cooling strategies. The objectives of Phase I are to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of accurate single-point physical modeling of internal and film cooling geometries using our CFD solver TETHYS, (ii) demonstrate the feasibility of sensitivity computation and uncertainty quantification using  TETHYS, (iii) apply these sensitivity and uncertainty quantification approaches to turbine blade cooling and to demonstrate their advantage over single-point CFD simulations, and (iv) develop and demonstrate multivariate optimization of a chosen turbine blade cooling problem.     Phase II will extend our methodology to geometry optimization, the improvement of physical models and numerical schemes, parallel processing on shared and distributed memory platforms and multicore architectures, as well as application to more complex optimization problems.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

The Phase I effort designs an area array ROIC compatible with surface micro-machined thermopile detectors to meet requirements of future NASA thermal instruments requiring D-Star > 4 x 109 Jones. Radiation hard-by-design will be utilized with 180 nm CMOS for low 1/f noise readout, operating temp 77-300 K, radiation hardness and noise immunity with on-ROIC ADC.

"1285","Retroreflector Array for Test Environments (RATE), Phase I","Research Support Instruments, Inc. (RSI) proposes to develop the Retroreflector Array for Test Environments (RATE), an innovative technology that will non-intrusively measure pressure on aerodynamic surfaces in NASA ground test facilities with high sensitivity and bandwidth.  The signal from RATE units will change locally due to pressure changes.  Pressure sensitive paints, in comparison, have serious drawbacks: they must applied to a rigid surface, are specific to the flow species, and do not retroreflect.  Because RATE will be independent of the flow species, and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material, it will be able to measure the aerodynamic pressure while minimizing changes in the flow field.  The Phase I RATE program will involve design, fabrication, and test of various candidate designs in order to select the most promising approach for Phase II.  RSI will use its experience in microfabricated structures and pressure sensors to employ a highly innovative technology in order to non-intrusively measure aerodynamic pressure in NASA ground test facilities.  The result will be a product that will address a critical NASA instrumentation need.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

"1292","Coronagraphic Planet Finding with Energy Resolving Detectors","We propose to build a 10,000 pixel MKID camera and integrate it with the Project 1640 coronagraph and the PALM-3000 adaptive optics system at the PaloMarch 200-inch telescope. With some modifications to the Project 1640 system, this will be the world's first visible through near infrared planet finding coronagraph.Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are an emerging superconducting detector technology capable of resolving the energy and arrival time of single photons with no dark current or read noise, and applicable from X-ray to sub-millimeter wavelengths. Our instrument will use an MKID array optimized for observing planets in the optical through near-IR wavelengths. When integrated with the Project 1640 coronagraph, our instrument will provide optical and near-IR spectra of giant planets and serve as a testbed for future ground and space-based planet finding missions.The impact of this technology will span nearly all wavelengths and fields of astronomy. With their unique capabilities, broad wavelength coverage, and conveniently multiplexable design, MKIDs have the potential to replace traditional semiconductor based detectors. When paired with the high-contrast imaging from Project 1640, this instrument could have a profound impact on exoplanet research, one of the youngest and most intriguing fields in astrophysics. This project promises to not only generate revolutionary new technology, but also to help answer fundamental questions about life in our universe.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed",NA,NA
"1293","WRF-STILT Particle Trajectories for Boston, MA, USA, 2013-2014","This dataset provides Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) particle trajectory data and footprint products for two receptors located in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, for July 2013 - December 2014. Meteorological fields from version 3.6.1 of the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the ""receptor"" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a ""footprint"" field. The footprint, with units of mixing ratio (ppm) per surface flux (umol m-2 s-1), quantifies the influence of upwind surface fluxes on CO2 and CH4 concentrations measured at the receptor and is computed by counting the number of particles in a surface-influenced volume and the time spent in that volume. Footprints are provided for the two receptors at two temporal and spatial scales: three days of surface influence over the whole North American coverage area at 1-degree resolution and 24 hours of surface influence within a smaller region close to the measurement locations ('near field') at 0.1-degree resolution.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        atmospheric-winds                        earth-science","public",NA

Flash Ladar Video Cameras are 3D vision systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time.  The ASC camera is the equivalent of 16000 range finders on a single chip.  This allows the sensor to act as a 3D video camera with functionality well beyond just range finding.  A previous Phase I EDL project used an ASC camera at the JPL mars yard to gather test data. Hazard Identification, and Entry Decent and Landing applications were investigated and the data demonstrated that a Flash LADAR system can resolve landing hazards and is suitable as an EDL sensor.    In response to this solicitation ASC will study unit cell designs that will increase sensitivity and dynamic range and allow for more compact unit cells that will yield higher density arrays.  The Phase two effort will yield a ROIC design and fabrication of a unit cell.  The end result will be a ROIC design ready for Phase 3 production of a large area array.  These improvements will increase the TRL level of this sensor.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA

Data collection for this product is complete.CERES EBAF Surface products provides computed monthly mean surface radiative fluxes that are consistent with the CERES EBAF-TOA products. In CERES EBAF-TOA products, the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes are constrained so that the global net TOA flux is consistent with our best estimate of heat storage in the Earth-atmosphere system (~0.58 Wm-2). CERES EBAF-Surface is primarily intended for studies that use Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) data to evaluate climate models, estimate the Earth's annual global mean energy budget, and infer meridional heat transports. The CERES EBAF-Surface data set is a single file in netCDF format. It consists of monthly 1 degree regional, zonal, and global averages of surface upward/downward longwave (LW), upward/downward shortwave (SW), and net fluxes under clear and all-sky conditions as well as associated net cloud radiative effects. Computed fluxes are based on hourly computations using cloud properties derived from narrow-band imagers onboard both Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua satellites as well as geostationary satellites to more fully model the diurnal cycle of clouds. The computations are also based on meteorological assimilation data from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Versions 5.4.1 models. Unlike other CERES Level 3 clear-sky regional data sets that contain clear-sky data gaps, the clear-sky fluxes in the EBAF-Surface product are regionally complete. The EBAF-Surface product is the CERES project's best estimate of the fluxes based on all available satellite platforms and input data.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.

"1301","InTILF Method for Analysis of Polished Mirror Surfaces, Phase I","Numerical simulation of the performance of new x-ray mirror performed by NASA and those under upgrade requires sophisticated and reliable information about the expected surface slope and height distributions of prospective x-ray optics before the optics are fabricated. Ideally, such information has to be based on the metrology data obtained from existing optics fabricated by the same vendor and technology, but, generally, with different sizes and slope and height rms variations. It has been demonstrated that an optical surface can be thought of as a stationary uniform random process. It was further shown that an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling of one-dimensional (1D) slope measurements allows highly confident fitting of the metrology x-ray mirrors data with a limited number of parameters. With the parameters of the ARMA model, the surface slope profile of an optic with the newly desired specification can be forecast reliably. However, ARMA models are causal and do not allow for generalization from one dimension to two. We propose to generalize the method from processing of one dimensional profile data to two dimensional surface data with invertible time-invariant linear filter (InTILF). This approach will also allow to parameterize surface metrology of high quality x-ray optics optimally. Our preliminary studies indicate that the InTILF approximation has all advantages of one-sided AR and ARMA modeling, but it additionally gains in terms of fewer filter parameters and better spectral accuracy. The envisioned software can also be used to analyze a polishing process and as a feedback for polishing tools.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA

The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is about 200 km cross-track. Thus, MAC02QS1 cross-track width is 804 pixels for radiances. Geolocations, however, are 1-km at best, and thus the cross-track width for geolocations is 201 pixels. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.In the standard product, the 250 meter MODIS Level 1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 2 discrete bands located in the 0.62 to 0.88 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

"1308","Extending In-Situ Dating to New Geochronometers: Pb-Pb, Sm-Nd, Re-Os, and LuHf","GoalsThis proposed work will extend laser ablation resonance ionization spectrometry (LARIMS) from the previously demonstrated rubidium-strontium (Rb-Sr) geochronology system to four other radiogenic systems, enabling in-situ, concordant age determinations to be made on extraterrestrial bodies in the solar system. This capability addresses a critical need to provide dating information to fulfill NASA’s goal of understanding the history of the solar system. Advantages include providing an independent test of concordance, while expanding the potential range of samples that can be successfully measured. Testing for concordance is important because individual isotopic dating systems can be biased by a variety of factors. These biases are frequently distinct for different radiometric systems. In addition to extending LARIMS to additional geochronology systems, an existing backup laser system will be advanced from TRL 2 to TRL 3.ObjectivesThis proposal addresses the important NASA goal to understand the history and evolution of the solar system. The time of key events in solar system history are poorly constrained by current samples, giving impetus to future missions with sample return and in-situ (landed) dating measurements. An issue for in-situ radiometric measurements is the desire for testing concordance, i.e. the ability to validate the measured age of a sample by using multiple dating systems. We have demonstrated LARIMS by dating several samples using the Rb-Sr method and we have completed preliminary work that demonstrates the technique can be extended to Pb-Pb geochronology. The objective of this proposal is to perform measurements that enable us to assess LARIMS capabilities with other geochronology systems and to determine and overcome obstacles to developing in-situ measurements based on these systems in future missions. This work, in combination with our successful (Rb-Sr) dating program, our recent lead-lead (Pb-Pb) dating study, and our preliminary samarium-neodymium (Sm-Nd) spectroscopy measurements, will complete a systematic study to assess the potential range of radiometric dating approaches for LARIMS analyses using a suite of geochronology dating systems, including Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, Sm-Nd, rhenium-osmium (Re-Os), and Lutetium-Hafnium (Lu-Hf).","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"1309","Dismantling Rubble Pile Asteroids with AoES (Area-of-Effect Soft-bots)","This proposal seeks to develop a new type of soft robotic spacecraft which is specifically designed to move efficiently on the surface of, and in proximity to, rubble pile asteroids. These new spacecraft are termed Area-of-Effect Soft-bots (AoES) as they have large surface areas which enable mobility that is especially effective at small asteroids. The surface mobility is enabled by using adhesion between the soft robot and the asteroid surface. The adhesive forces also allow the AoES to anchor themselves in order to liberate material from the asteroid and launch it off the surface for collection by an orbiting resource processing spacecraft – forming the fundamental pieces of a resource utilization mission to a near-Earth asteroid (NEA). Furthermore, the large area necessary for the adhesion based mobility and anchoring also gives the AoES a relatively high area-to-mass ratio, enabling fuel-free orbit control using solar radiation pressure (SRP) forces. In total, this concept elegantly overcomes many of the difficulties typically encountered when trying to design a mission to retrieve a significant amount of material from an asteroid surface – in many cases using these perceived difficulties (e.g. microgravity, fast spin rates) to the advantage of the architecture. Development of AoES in order to make this mission architecture feasible therefore has the potential to drastically improve the capabilities of harvesting water and other resources from the variety of small, plentiful, easily accessible NEAs – enabling further exploration and economic profit in the solar system.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        university-of-color...",NA,NA

The proposed instrument uses range-resolved elastic backscatter data from a scanning lidar beam to generate a 3D map of aerosol density in a short time span. Aerosol density fluctuations are cross-correlated between successive scans to obtain the displacements of the aerosol features along the three axes. Current methods of non-intrusive global airspeed measurement include Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV). Common drawbacks of these methods are that they require precise alignment of separate transmitters and receivers; and it is expensive and unwieldy to extend these measurements for use in medium and large wind tunnels.In Phase I, AeroMancer identified the main requirements of the application and the instrument; developed a conceptual design of a Phase II prototype; identified 3D airspeed extraction algorithms; and benchmarked the performance of the prototype using experiments and numerical simulations.In Phase II, AeroMancer will develop the final design of the prototype by finalizing the requirements; and by performing trade studies and an eye safety analysis to select major components. The prototype will then be fabricated, assembled and packaged for wind tunnel use. Algorithms for the extraction of 3D global airspeeds, turbulence and solid object identification will be developed. Different scanning approaches will be developed and sources of error in the measurement will be analyzed and quantified. Software packages for control, data acquisition, storage and processing will be developed. The prototype will be tested in the laboratory for alignment, calibration, verification and validation. Limited wind tunnel testing will be performed if resources permit.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

The proposed chemical sensor probes will be a new class of on-board engine instrumentation for real time monitoring of engine and bleed air system operation in flight.  Sensor arrays developed by MEI have been demonstrated for ground tests usage to quantify composition of critical constituents in turbine engine exhaust products, e.g., CO, CO2, NOx, O2 and HC (unburned hydrocarbons).  There currently is no flight capable instrumentation for real time measurement of high temperature gas streams from engine bleed air or the turbine exhaust.  Ground test demonstrations with high temperature capable (500 to 600 (deg) C) solid-state chemical microsensors have shown the potential value for engine health monitoring and detection of engine faults or abnormal operations from ingestion of high moisture levels or particulate from volcanic emissions.

Cellular Load Responsive (""CLR"") multilayer insulation integrates a mid-size cryopumping self-evacuating vacuum cell core with load bearing LRMLI within the compartments. CLR can offer a structural, high performance insulation system, that is damage tolerant, can support external loads such as thermal shields, and provides good thermal insulation both in-air (for ground and ascent phases) and in-vacuum (once in-space). CLR could provide 92% lower heat leak in-air during ground hold, and 97% lower heat leak in-space than SOFI.NASA's Technology Roadmaps call ""Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions"" and ""Nuclear Thermal Propulsion components and systems"" the #2 and #7 ranked technical challenge for future NASA missions.In this Phase I program, a CLRMLI system would be modeled, analyzed, designed, fabricated, installed on a cryotank, and tested for thermal performance for ground/ascent and in-space operation.

"1338","Next Generation X-ray Polarimeter","The emission regions of many types of X-ray sources are small and cannot be spatially resolved without interferometry techniques that haven’t yet been developed. In order to understand the emission mechanisms and emission geometry, alternate measurement techniques are required. Most microphysical processes that affect X-rays, including scattering and magnetic emission processes are imprinted as polarization signatures. X-ray polarization also reveals exotic physical processes occurring in regions of very strong gravitational and magnetic fields. Observations of X-ray polarization will provide a measurement of the geometrical distribution of gas and magnetic fields without foreground depolarization that affects longer wavelengths (e.g. Faraday rotation in the radio).Emission from accretion disks has an inclination-dependent polarization. The polarization signature is modified by extreme gravitational forces, which bend light, essentially changing the contribution of each part of the disk to the integrated total intensity seen by distant observers. Because gravity has the largest effect on the innermost parts of the disk (which are the hottest, and thus contributes to more high energy photons), the energy dependent polarization is diagnostic of disk inclination, black hole mass and spin. Increasing the sensitive energy band will make these measurements possible. X-ray polarimetry will also enable the study of the origin of cosmic rays in the universe, the nature of black holes, the role of black holes in the evolution of galaxies, and the interaction of matter with the highest physically possible magnetic fields. These objectives address NASA’s strategic interest in the origin, structure, and evolution of the universe.We propose a two-year effort to develop the Next Generation X-ray Polarimeter (NGXP) that will have more than ten times the sensitivity of the current state of the art. NGXP will make possible game changing measurements of classes of astrophysical sources that were previously unobtainable within realistic observation times e.g. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).Standard photoelectric X-ray polarimeter designs are both quantum efficiency (QE) limited and challenging to calibrate due to diffusion of electron signal as it drifts through the gas. Drifting negative ions decreases diffusion to the thermal limit thereby decoupling sensitivity from drift distance and enabling larger detector areas that can be at the focus of larger diameter mirrors and single reflection concentrator optics. NITPCs also allow the selection of constituent gasses and pressures to be based on the optimization of modulation and QE rather than diffusion properties. This versatility enables a large improvement in sensitivity without driving cost and with only moderate increase to mass and power of the detector and/or instrument. Furthermore, the energy band of NGXP will be tunable to maximize the science return. Following the efforts of this proposal NGXP will be proposed as sounding rocket experiment and as a candidate instrument for future opportunities.The GSFC polarimeter group has demonstrated NITPCs for several detector concepts. This proposal leverages the previous effort and team expertise with goals to establish the NITPC as the baseline for narrow field observations of faint persistent sources and to improve the technology readiness of associated technologies such as stainless steel gas electron multipliers and finer readout pitch.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"1339","Novel Foul-Resistant Nano-Pervaporation Membrane for Medical Grade Water Generation, Phase I","Extended-duration spaceflight requires self-sustained patient care capable for the treatment of emergency medical conditions, thus requiring medical grade water to reconstitute pharmacological substances when needed. Conventional method to produce medical grade water is either energy inefficient or too complex, requiring high pressure and using considerable consumables. We propose a novel foul-resistant nano-pervaporation (NVP) membrane with minimized mass, volume, consumables, and power consumption for producing medical grade water in both micro-g and sub-g environments. Our proposed concept is based on a near-room-temperature pervaporation process. The nano-pore selectively adsorbs liquid water and excludes other undesirable constituents in the portable water, such as particles, microbes, virus, and volatile organic compounds. The permeated water vapor is subsequently condensed allowing the heat of evaporation to be recovered. This smart system uses space vacuum to obtain low vapor pressure, together with a build-in heat recovery, aims at minimizing the required power. This membrane is foul-resistant.  It only requires a low pressure gradient to achieve high water flow rate, minimizing the driving force for fouling. Also, without any moving part, the system enjoys low maintenance. The NPV process shows potentially the lowest amount of power consumption, mass/volume, and consumables among possible technologies for producing medical grade water.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA

"1341","Crack Closure Based Self Healing Process for Metallic Structures, Phase I","Analytical Services and Materials, Inc. (AS&M) is proposing to develop and validate a process that can extend the fatigue life of and potentially self-heal existing fatigue damage of aluminum and titanium alloys.  The genesis of the proposed process is research conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center that developed a low melting point coating that flows into the crack when activated.  The fatigue crack growth was postulated to be reduced due to a combination of adherence of the healing material to the crack surfaces (crack bridging) and filling of the crack with the healing material (crack closure).  This process was demonstrated to reduce the crack growth rate (i.e., extend fatigue life) by a factor of 2 to 4x in inert environments.  The proposed Phase I program will deliver experimental evidence of a self-healing material system and a preliminary design for an integrated healing activation system.

"1345","Three Band Cloud and Precipitation Radar","We propose to design and demonstrate key enabling technologies for Cloud and Precipitation radars capable of closing the observational gaps left by current and upcoming missions (i.e., TRMM, CloudSat, GPM and EarthCARE), and identified by the cloud-precipitation science community as essential for the advancement of global characterization of the cloud-precipitation processes and their correct modeling in weather and climate models. The proposed instrument is Three-band (Ku/Ka/W-band) Cloud and Precipitation Radar (3CPR). 3CPR enables the simultaneous three-band observation, Doppler measurement, cross-track electronic scanning, and polarimetry). 3CPR achieves this using an extremely versatile and efficient antenna system referred to as ACPRA (Advanced Cloud and Precipitation Radar Antenna). ACPRA combines the high gain of a large parabolic-cylindrical reflector with the beam agility of an electronically-scanned feed system. The 3CPR configuration fulfills the draft requirements of a Global Cloud and Pre-cipitation Mission (GPCM). The Ka-/W-band subset of the 3CPR design satisfies all of the requirements and most of the goals of the Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) mission. It would also meet the requirements set by the snowfall measurement community. The key enabling technology meeting the requirements of GPCM and ACE is the W-band ACPRA. Using recent technological advancements in microfabricated interconnects and radiators, GaN and SiGe MMICs together with innovations in feed array design, we will demonstrate a W-band electronically-scanned array-fed reflector system. The reflector will be a scaled version of the 3CPR antenna with W-band scanning electronics. We will demonstrate this technology in thermal vacuum and vibration environments, advancing the key technology from TRL3 to TRL5. This TRL advancement along with a comprehensive instrument design and accommodation study to be performed during this task will bring the 3CPR instrument to TRL5, ready for Phase A start for ACE, GPCM, or other mission concepts by 2017.Develop and demonstrate key enabling technologies for a spaceborne three-band (Ku/Ka/W-band) 3CPR capable of simultaneous three-frequency, Doppler, cross-track scanning, and polarimetric measurements of hydrometeors (clouds, rainfall, snowfall). 3CPR will: - enable global characterization of cloud-precipitation processes and their correct representation in weather and climate models - fulfill all radar requirements for the ACE measurement concept, the anticipated radar requirements in the post-GPM mission era, and those set by snowfall science community. Special emphasis will be placed on developing 3CPR's electronic scanning antenna – the Advanced Cloud and Precipitation Radar Antenna (ACPRA).","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        nasa-headquarters",NA,NA
"1346","Broadband light rejection with the optical vortex coronagraph","Our primary objective is to continue to improve the demonstrated performance of the optical vortex coronagraph, by extending our previous work from monochromatic to broadband light.  Our specific goals here are thus demonstrations of broadband pseudo-starlight rejection at the 10-9 level (first for 10% bandwidth, and then 20%) using JPL's Compact Coronagraph (CC) testbed.We plan to carry out thorough mask testing by using our five existing test facilities that are fully available to us at JPL: a polarizing microscope, our polarization spectrometer, our Muller Matrix Imaging Polarimeter, the Infrared Coronagraphic Testbed  (which also operates in the visible), and the new high-contrast Compact Coronagraph (CC). In particular, we have found Muller matrix imaging and cross-polarization spectroscopy to be extremely valuable initial measurement tools that can immediately characterize a vortex's wavelength response, thereby allowing us to better focus our efforts in the CC to only the most worthy vortices. Quick initial coronagraphic tests (without wavefront control) are also possible in the IRCT. Thus the vacuum CC would only be used for final deep testing of already vetted vortex masks. All of these initial steps should thus minimize the time needed in the high-contrast CC, thus maximizing efficiency and minimizing cost.Because of their high throughput and small inner working angle, vortex coronagraphs are of great interest to potential NASA's corona graphic missions such as Exo-C and HabEx, as well as to forthcoming large ground-based telescopes. A vortex coronagraph is also planned for the NASA-funded balloon project Picture-C, and that mission will specifically require broadband vortices.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"1347","Programmable Phase Nulling Interferometer for Giant Mirrors, Phase I","We propose the development of a programmable phase nulling interferometer that extends the capability of a computer generated hologram (CGH) to null test a range of meter class telescope mirrors, instead of a single one for which it was designed. The active element is a crystal on silicon (LCoS) spatial light modulator (SLM). The SLM corrects for the residual wavefront remaining when a CGH is used to test a mirror for which it was not designed. An aperture F-number trade space exists in which a range of mirrors can be null tested with one CGH. The prototype can be modularly added-on to a railed interferometric test setup with a CGH. In Phase I a system will be constructed with a 512x512 SLM in a brassboard Twyman-Green interferometer to null test a 10 inch F3.5 or F4 parabolic mirror. It will resemble the proposed prototype, but without a CGH, as in this case the SLM alone can null the phase error from the mirror. Tests of null quality and repeatability will be performed and measures to eliminate modulo 2p phase artifacts will be implemented. The Phase 1 brassboard will be controlled with a labVIEW executable and delivered to NASA.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA

The OCO-2 project uses the LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to the Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectral elements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.This product is the output from the Level 1B process. It converts the raw instrument data numbers into calibrated radiances. This conversion is based upon files of instrument characteristics and algorithm parameters that may vary over time. In addition to calibrated radiances, the Level 1B output products have geolocation information recorded for each measurement for use in higher-level processes.This is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-chemistry                        earth-science                        infrared-wavelengths                        national-geospatial...                        ngda                        spectral-engineering","public",NA

"1357","HELIX: The High Energy Light Isotope Experiment, PSU Co-I","This is a Co-I proposal (Lead Proposal is from Scott Wakely, University of Chicago) for a new suborbital program, HELIX (High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment), designed to make measurements of the isotopic composition of light cosmic ray nuclei from ~200 MeV/nuc to ~10 GeV/nuc. Past measurements of this kind have provided profound insights into the nature and origin of cosmic rays, revealing, for instance, information on acceleration and confinement time scales, and exposing some conspicuous discrepancies between solar and cosmic-ray abundances. The most detailed information currently available comes from the ACE/CRIS mission, but is restricted to energies below a few 100 MeV/nuc. HELIX aims at extending this energy range by over an order of magnitude, to energies where, in many cases, no measurements of any kind exist. The HELIX measurements will provide essential information for understanding the propagation history of cosmic rays in the galaxy. This is a crucial element for properly interpreting several intriguing anomalies reported in recent cosmic-ray measurements, pertaining to the energy spectra of protons, helium, and heavier nuclei, and perhaps most strikingly, to the anomalous rise in the positron fraction at higher energy.HELIX employs a high-precision magnet spectrometer to provide measurements which are not achievable by any current or planned instrument. The detector system will incorporate the existing superconducting magnet constructed for the HEAT payload, which has successfully operated on five previous high-altitude campaigns. This magnet will be combined with state-of-the-art detectors to measure the charge, time-of-flight, magnetic rigidity, and velocity of cosmic-ray particles with high precision. Specifically, the instrument will combine plastic scintillators, a silicon-strip tracker with ~30 micron spatial resolution, a high-performance drift chamber, and a ring-imaging Cherenkov counter employing aerogel radiators.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"1358","Real-Time Methods for Adaptive Suppression of Adverse Aeroservoelastic Dynamics, Phase I","Adverse aeroservoelastic (ASE) interaction is a problem on new and existing aircraft of all types causing repeated loading, enhanced fatigue and undesirable oscillations for pilots. Traditionally, to suppress adverse ASE interaction, notch and/or roll off filters have been utilized in the flight control system architecture to effectively ""cancel out"" problematic frequencies that will potentially excite the ASE dynamics. This solution has pitfalls; rigid body performance is degraded due to the resulting phase penalty and the filter is not robust to unexpected or un-modeled off nominal behavior. STI proposes an adaptive approach, which is leveraged by the adaptive Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) algorithm for high frequency disturbance rejection. This adaptive approach is robust to system variations, minimizes lower frequency phase penalty, and has been utilized for similar dynamic systems with supporting experimental validation. Development of the adaptive HHC algorithm for ASE suppression will be accomplished utilizing a high fidelity model of a representative high-speed fighter aircraft that is capable of parameter variation consisting of flight condition changes, configuration changes (stores configurations) as well as damage and failures. Validation of the proposed approach will be accomplished via simulation with representative parameter variations. Validation via real-time piloted simulations is proposed for future studies.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        dryden-flight-resea...",NA,NA

This dataset contains estimates of static field geopotential of the Earth, derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission measurements, produced by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ).  The data are in spherical harmonics averaged over approximately a month.  The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field variations.  This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 500 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 200 km apart, using a microwave ranging system.  In addition to these range change, the non-gravitional forces are measured on each satellite using a high accuracy electrostatic, room-temperature accelerometer.  The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using twin star cameras and a GPS receiver, respectively.  Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field affect the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently.  These differences are manifested as changes in the distance between the spacecraft, as they orbit the Earth.  This change in distance is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft.  The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals.  The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements.  This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the parameters of an Earth gravity field model.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/JPL/PODAAC","earth-science                        gravity-gravitation...                        ocean-pressure                        oceans                        solid-earth","public",NA

Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The SLH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the SLH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","atmosphere                        clouds                        earth-science                        national-geospatial...                        ngda","TRMM, geospatial",NA

Figure 5 summarizes the RAISE instrument design, showing photographs of each of&nbsp; the components or subsystems. The design uses an off-axis parabolic telescope mirror to form a real&nbsp; image of the sun on the spectrometer entrance aperture. A slit then selects a portion of the solar image,&nbsp; passing its light onto a near-normal incidence toroidal grating, which re-images the spectrally dispersed&nbsp; radiation onto two array detectors. Two full spectral passbands over the same one-dimensional spatial&nbsp; field are recorded simultaneously with no scanning of the detectors or grating. The two different spectral&nbsp; bands (1st-order 1205-1243&Aring; and 1526-1564&Aring;) are imaged onto two intensified Active Pixel Sensor&nbsp; (APS) detectors whose focal planes are individually adjusted for optimized performance. The telescope&nbsp; and grating are coated with B4C to enhance short wavelength (2nd order) reflectance (Fig. 6), enabling the&nbsp; instrument to record the brightest lines between 602-622&Aring; and 761-780&Aring; at the same time.

By&nbsp; combining this VLS concept with toroidal surfaces, RAISE is the first to exploit this new class of&nbsp; spectrometers, as described by Thomas (2003).

"1367","Development of Optics and Detectors for Advanced CMB Polarization Measurements","Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been essential to the development of modern cosmology. Future observations will provide cosmological constraints from structure formation as well as improved characterization of inflation in the early universe.  Starting in 2008, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measured the CMB temperature on arcminute scales, discovered galaxy clusters through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and when combined with measurements from NASA's WMAP satellite provided evidence for the existence of dark energy for the first time using CMB measurements alone.  With this NSTRF fellowship I plan to work towards the development of optics and detector technologies for a next generation instrument to be deployed on ACT. ACT is a six-meter telescope located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at an elevation of 5190 m. A polarization sensitive upgrade to ACT, known as ACTPol, is now beginning observations. Throughout the length of the fellowship, we will work to implement and observe with ACTPol. We will be able to study the growth of cosmic structure in our universe via detections of galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing of the CMB and will improve constraints on cosmological parameters that describe the early universe.With the use of approximately 3,000 superconducting detectors operating at 90 GHz and 150 GHz, ACTPol will enable high precision measurements of the polarization of the CMB.  One of my goals during the fellowship is to help develop a future upgrade to ACT that will provide wider frequency coverage with many more detectors. An important aspect of this project will be research into reading out larger superconducting detector arrays, which could impact technologies for future NASA space missions, such as a next generation X-ray observatory or the Inflation Probe.  This as well as research on silicon optics will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The optics research is relevant to measurements over a wide range of wavelengths, from far infrared to millimeter wave, and could be used on future NASA missions at these wavelengths. The research conducted under this fellowship will contribute towards improving the technology readiness levels of all the associated technologies for use in future NASA missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        cornell-university",NA,NA

Data for this data set are acquired from the PWS waveform receiver. Data are presented as time series of 4-bit voltage measurements acquired at the rate of 28,800 samples per second through a 40 Hz to 12 kHz bandpass filter. An automatic gain control is used to keep the signal within the usable range of the 4-bit digitization, however, the gain information is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no direct, absolute calibration. However, a power spectrum analysis returns a spectrum that has accurate relative amplitudes between spectral elements.

Unique features of this model include (1) the ability to model rarefied flows with localized continuum features at high altitudes, (2) the ability to model both ablative and non-ablative thermal protection systems, and (3) the ability to model multiple firings of reaction control jets.  The model will permit analyzing high-speed, nonequilibrium flows about entry and aeroassist vehicles based on extensions to three-dimensional Navier-Stokes and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) codes.  Extension will include effects of liquid and solid particulates along with gaseous species, which should significantly enhance the ability to analyze complex ablation effects.  The coupling of these tools to include modeling of multiple reaction-control-jet firings will provide essential data for assessing the aerothermodynamic performance for a wide range of vehicle designs over a wide range of vehicle altitudes and flight conditions.

One file contains quarterly above-ground biomass data for grasses on the steepe (May 1984-May 1985). The second file contains average annual above-ground primary production (ANPP) data for grasses and shrubs for years 1972-1997 based upon peak above-ground biomass estimates. The third file contains precipitation and maximum/minimum temperature data for the Rio Mayo site for the period 1968 through 1990.Rio Mayo is located in the Patagonia region of Argentina. The vegetation is chiefly composed of grasses and shrubs. Harvest methods were used to estimate grass and shrub production. Between 1972 and 1997, peak annual ANPP of grasses plus shrubs ranged from 21 to 75 g/m2/yr, with an average of about 60 g/m2/yr. Grasses accounted for about two-thirds of the productivity. ANPP was reduced in a drought year, but did not increase in relatively wet years, suggesting that it may not be linearly related to precipitation. ANPP for 1984-1985 was slightly higher (79 g/m2/yr) when a different algorithm was used for estimation. Revision Notes: The original npp data file (rmy_npp.txt) has been split into two files, one file containing seasonal biomass and the other containing annual ANPP estimates. The data file containing annual ANPP estimates has been revised to extend temporage coverage and add additional annual ANPP data.

"1376","Model Annotations and Tools for Teamwork, Execution, and Reuse (MATTER), Phase I","In order to carry out space-based science missions, NASA is responsible for designing, developing, and operating very complex, long-lived, and expensive systems.  Early investment in analyzing a wide range of options can produce markedly better designs.  That means pervasive modeling and simulation (M&S) early in conceptual design could pay large dividends for NASA, especially if M&S were cheaper to carry out, and if resulting models could be exploited throughout and across projects.We propose to develop Model Annotations and Tools for Teamwork, Execution, and Reuse (MATTER).  This innovative technology will increase the efficiency and value of model-based systems engineering (MBSE).  MATTER will improve on existing SysML-based MBSE by defining new types of metadata that enable valuable processing capabilities not supported by the standard SysML language and existing tools: (1) Semantic descriptions capturing the intended uses of model fragments will encourage reuse, when combined with tools for managing and searching a model library; (2) Additional descriptions of model component interfaces will enable efficient composition and configuration of models; (3) Annotations on the behaviors and constraints of model elements will ease automation of simulation generation and analysis; (4) Tracking of model changes--including version branches representing alternate designs--will facilitate flexible trade analysis, model continuity and evolution across the project lifecycle, and teamwork; and (5) Generation and routing of change notifications will further coordinate team efforts, as awareness of shifts in inputs or the irrelevance of intended outputs will reduce wasted work.During this project, we will design the system and develop a software prototype that illustrates the feasibility and utility of this approach.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA
"1377","Multi-fluid Studies of Chromospheric Reconnection in a Partially Ionized Laboratory Plasma","The solar chromosphere provides the critical transition between the plasma pressure dominated convection zone, where coronal magnetic fields originate, and the magnetically dominated corona, where these fields interact with each other to drive solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The reconnection and reorganization of the magnetic field from plasma-forced to magnetically-forced which occurs in this region as fields emerge from the convection zone into the corona is therefore a critical, though as yet poorly understood, process. Most of the past work in theory and simulation to model ion-neutral drag has used a single-fluid approach where an ambipolar diffusion term is added to Ohm's Law. However, this approach may not be valid for the multi-scale problem which requires multiple fluid models. We propose to contribute to this work through a collaboration between experiment and simulation. The team at the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) has performed initial studies of reconnection in both two- and three-fluid regimes. Recent studies have focused on measurements of ion flows, but we propose to spectroscopically measure neutral flows, which can be compared to observations. For simulations, we will use HiFi, a multi-fluid code that is already being used to model reconnection in the solar chromosphere. We plan to determine how neutrals affect reconnection rate, structures in the reconnection region, and associated heating and flows in both regimes. To our knowledge, the proposed laboratory experiments are only available tools to validate numerical codes used to model reconnection phenomena in the solar chromosphere.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        princeton-university",NA,NA
"1378","SiC Matrix Composites for High Temperature Hypersonic Vehicle Applications, Phase I","Durable high temperature materials are required for hypersonic engine and structural thermal protection systems.  In particular, 2700ºF or greater capable structural materials that can survive stresses on the order of 10 ksi (70 MPa) for at least 100 hours in an oxidizing environment have been identified as an enabling material for future hypersonic vehicles with a long term desired target of 3000ºF.  As these applications are structural, a strong degree of damage tolerance is desired, and thus ceramic matrix composites are the primary choice due to the desire for reduced weight, high temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composites are believed to be the most suitable solution due to meeting the requirements with the exception of creep at the highest temperatures/loads. The proposed effort will modify the SiC fiber preform by the addition of a fraction of more creep resistant carbon fibers.  The Phase I will encompass engineering the appropriate level of hybridization in a C-SiC/SiC composite, producing and evaluating the ceramic composite material for hypersonic vehicle applications, including stress rupture at temperatures of 2700ºF or greater.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

This is especially true for high reliability teams such as long duration (LD) space flight crews that have to perform in extreme environments. Effective teamwork is essential for minimizing errors and supporting team performance, and it is reflective of good psychosocial adaptation to the stresses of LD space missions. Research Plan: This research had two key goals: (a) benchmarking variation in team collaboration and team cohesion over LD missions and (b) further developing a monitoring and regulation system to unobtrusively measure team collaboration and cohesion.  For (a), there is substantial research that documents a relationship between team cohesion and effectiveness; however, that evidentiary foundation is based on static data. We are systematically examining variation in team cohesion and collaboration in LD analog teams operating in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments. In prior research we had collected preliminary data for ICE teams operating in the Antarctic and had detected evidence for considerable variation in cohesion levels over time. This project extended the research to larger samples and longer durations to help calibrate expected levels of cohesion variability, which is essential for developing appropriate models to benchmark team psycho-social health. For (b), one key component of the monitoring system is a technology--a wearable sensor network--that assesses the frequency, duration, distance, and quality of collaboration as team members work together. In prior research we had developed functional prototypes and had initiated a series of basic laboratory validation studies. That work provided preliminary validation evidence demonstrating that the monitoring technology is capable of accurately capturing team member interactions (relative to video coding of interactions) in highly structured collaborations. The current research advanced the prior research to develop the monitoring and regulation system by: (a) extending validation research of the monitoring technology to capture successively more complex and naturalistic team interaction dynamics, and (b) initiating the development of a feedback “dashboard” to display multiple data streams (collaboration frequency, duration, and distance; physiological arousal) that can help diagnose the effectiveness of collaboration and teamwork. Specific Aims: The purpose of this proposal was to (1) extend our benchmarking of LD team functioning in ICE environments, (2) extend the validation process for the monitoring and regulation system and begin to develop a data fusion model, and (3) develop a feedback dashboard to display multimodal data on team functioning. Project deliverables: (1) benchmarking data for long duration analog teams in operating in ICE environments, (2) validation evidence to establish proof-of-concept for the monitoring technology and preliminary development of a data fusion model, and (3) a feedback dashboard display to diagnose team functioning based on multimodal monitoring data.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA
"1388","UARS Correlative NMC Daily Gridded Stratospheric Assimilated Data V001 (UARZCNMC) at GES DISC","The UARS Correlative assimilation data from NOAA's National Meteorological Center (NMC) consists of daily model runs at 12 GMT as a means of providing an independent analysis for comparison with data from the UARS instruments. The NMC data product includes temperature (Kelvin), humidity (%), geopotential height (m), and zonal and meridional wind components (m/s).Geopotential height and atmospheric temperature data are derived from two analysis systems: 1) tropospheric fields from 1000 to 100 mb, and 2) stratospheric analyses from 70 to 0.4 mb. The tropospheric fields are the 12 GMT gridded fields which are part of the Global Daily Assimilation System (GDAS), where data from radiosondes, aircraft, satellites, ships, bouys, or any other conventional means are assimilated and merged into meteorological fields (heights, temperature, winds). The stratospheric analyses are 12 GMT operational analyses at the 70 - 0.4 mb pressure levels produced from satellite temperature retrievals and RAOBS via a modified Cressman analysis. Tropospheric temperature analyses use combined NOAA-10 and NOAA-11 data. Moisture (northern hemisphere only) and Winds data are obtained from the NMC GDAS.The gridded fields are on the standard 65 x 65 NMC polar stereographic grid oriented 80W (grid increment 381 km at 60N), and 100E (grid increment 381 km at 60S); Pole at (33,33). The NMC uses 18 standard pressure levels for data at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.4 millibars. Height and temperature data are produced at all 18 pressure levels from 1000 mb to 0.4 mb. Moisture data are only produced in the northern hemisphere for the 6 lowest altitude pressure levels. Wind data are produced for the 12 lowest altitude levels in the northern hemisphere, and at the 4 levels 1000, 500, 300, and 250 mb in the southern hemisphere.There are four data files representing each subtype per day. Included in the NMC correlative data set will be a geographical data richness file. This file is used by the NMC access routines, and indicates the radiosonde coverage for each point on the NMC grid. The data files are available in a binary record oriented format.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","altitude                        atmosphere                        atmospheric-tempera...                        atmospheric-water-v...                        atmospheric-winds                        earth-science","public",NA

"1391","Development of an Earth Smallsat Flight Test to Demonstrate Viability of Mars Aerocapture","Aerocapture is an orbit insertion technique that offers significant reductions in mass and cost for a large number of space missions. Despite its benefits, one of the main reasons that aerocapture has not been used on a flight mission is that it has not yet been flight tested. The research proposed here will address this problem by designing an Earth-based aerocapture flight test utilizing a smallsat.Conceptual design of the flight test will focus on producing a fully-documented mission concept to demonstrate aerocapture. One of the primary conceptual challenges involves developing an aerocapture flight system for use on a smallsat. Techniques such as drag modulation-based energy control will be considered to reduce the system complexity. System selection will be accomplished through means of a comprehensive trade study; focus will be placed on control and thermal requirements, simplicity, and the applicability of the system to other missions. The chosen system will drive other facets of mission design, such as the guidance method utilized by the smallsat and selection of the mission trajectory.The second phase of this research will focus on physically developing and testing the aerocapture system and spacecraft in preparation for the smallsat test flight. A secondary payload mission architecture will be utilized for the flight test to minimize cost. The design process of the spacecraft will offer a number of opportunities for student leadership and multidisciplinary collaboration. A successful demonstration will show that aerocapture can be used as an effective means of orbit insertion at Mars and other atmospheric worlds, with scalable applications to both large and small spacecraft and missions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        georgia-institute-o...",NA,NA

"1393","Vehicle Interior Noise Prediction Using Energy Finite Element Analysis, Phase II","It is proposed to develop and implement a computational technique based on Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) for interior noise prediction of advanced aerospace vehicles that will expand NASA's noise prediction capability at the early stage of design process. In many situations, aerospace structures are subjected to high frequency mechanical and/or acoustic excitations. Presently, noise performances of these products are determined experimentally, which is not feasible at the early design stage or by using computational simulation technique based on Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). SEA requires high level of analyst expertise and in some instances, testing of the product's components. An alternative computational simulation technique for high frequency vibration and noise prediction based on EFEA conceptually offers several unique features. EFEA can predict the spatial variation of the energy in structures and the acoustic cavities. Local power input and damping treatments can also be modeled in EFEA. More importantly, EFEA is based on extensively used and comprehensively developed finite element method. The use of finite element method for both low and high frequency noise and vibration problems will provide the users a unified framework for the resolution of problems where the frequency spans a wide range.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"1396","UV LED-based Charge Management System for the LISA Gravitational Reference Sensor","Within the next ~year, we will see the advent of observational gravitational wave astronomy. The twin Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatories (LIGO) have just concluded their first observation run, with sensitivities meeting the LIGO lab’s highest expectations in the 10 Hz to 1 kHz frequency band. Pulsar timing arrays, which observe gravitational waves in the nHz range, will soon follow LIGO gravitational wave detections. However, it is gravitational wave observation in the 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz band, which can only be observed from space, that provides the richest and most compelling science. A space-based observatory will improve our understanding of the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in extreme conditions, and enable searches for new physics.All space-based gravitational wave observatories, like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), require free falling masses where all classical external forces are reduced below the tidal forces of the oscillating spacetime metric. A single test mass together with its protective electrode housing and associated components is referred to as a gravitational reference sensor (GRS). The journey toward a space-based observatory is well underway with the successful December 2015 launch of LISA Pathfinder (LPF), which is now stationed at its Earth-Sun L1 operating point. LPF will test the GRS and its closed loop drag-free operation. However, the design of the LPF gravitational reference sensor was solidified more than a decade ago. Since that time, new component technologies have been developed that can improve the sensor’s acceleration noise performance and/or reduce complexity and technological risk.An advanced charged management system (CMS) is one such technology that has become one of the highest technological needs for a future space-based observatory, according to the Gravitational Observatory Advisory Team’s interim report. This assessment is based on the marginal performance of the existing LISA Pathfinder CMS both in laboratory experiments and in testing of the LPF flight hardware. The charge management system controls the bulk potential of the test mass relative to its housing, which is vital for reducing force noise acting on the test mass below the required level.We will develop an advanced charge management system to technology readiness level (TRL) 5 by 2020 that will utilize new, efficient, semiconductor UV sources instead of the Hg vapor lamps used by LISA Pathfinder. Compared to Hg lamps, these UV LEDs are smaller and lighter, consume less power, have a wider spectrum selection, and a much higher dynamic range, with at least an order of magnitude improvement in each performance area. The proposed CMS will improve the robustness of test mass charge control by taking advantage of the higher energy (lower wavelength) UV light produced by these sources, as well as the higher-bandwidth that enables AC charge control, a scheme that is more impervious to test mass or electrode housing surface impurities.Preparations for NASA’s contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA)-led L3 gravitational wave mission have begun. Although the launch of this observatory is planned for the early 2030’s, any potential NASA technology contribution must reach TRL 5 by the year 2020, according to the ESA schedule. Therefore, gravitational wave technology development in the U.S. is an immediate priority for NASA. The CMS technology proposed here has already been identified as a potential NASA contribution to the L3 mission by the European eLISA Consortium and by NASA itself. Since the L3 mission plans to switch to a UV LED-based CMS, and because of the PI’s expertise with this important GRS technology and the fact that UV LEDs are only produced by vendors in the U.S., the proposed technology is a natural NASA contribution to the L3 mission.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

Techsburg will be receiving endorsement and support for this research from the Goodrich Company who owns the HQ waveguide array concept.  Thus far linear acoustic modeling has been used to design HQ waveguide arrays that have experimentally proven to be successful in attenuating far-field sound radiation from subsonic ducted fans.  However, the large transonic turbofan engines used in most civil aviation aircraft today produce large amplitude bow shocks upstream of the fan rotor that nonlinearly scatter energy from the dominant BPF circumferential mode near the fan rotor to primarily lower engine order circumferential modes at the duct entrance, which produces the ""buzz-saw"" far-field acoustic signature.  The non-linear design tool developed by Techsburg/Virginia Tech in Phase I will be used to design an optimal HQ waveguide array in Phase II that will be placed near the fan with the intention of attenuating the BPF circumferential mode in order to reduce scattered energy into lower engine orders that cause far-field ""buzz-saw"" noise.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"1412","Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) from the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite in Native Format","ERBE_TSI_ERBS_NAT data set contains Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) data from the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) in native format.The goal of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is to produce monthly averages of longwave and shortwave radiation parameters on the Earth at regional to global scales. Preflight mission analysis lead to a three spacecraft system to provide the geographic and temporal sampling required to meet this goal. Three nearly identical sets of instruments were built and launched on three separate spacecraft. These instruments differ principally in the spacecraft interface electronics and in the field-of-view limiters for the nonscanner instruments required because of differences in the spacecraft orbit altitudes.The ERBS spacecraft was launched by Space Shuttle Challenger in October 1984 and was the first spacecraft to carry ERBE instruments into orbit. ERBS was designed and built by Ball Aerospace Systems under contract to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and ERBS was the first spacecraft dedicated to NASA science experiments to be launched by the Space Shuttle. ERBS carries the Stratospheric Aerosols and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) in addition to the ERBE instruments. The Payload Operation and Control Center (POCC) at GSFC directs operations of the ERBS spacecraft and the ERBE and SAGE II instruments, employing both ground stations and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) network. Spacecraft and instrument telemetry data are received at GSFC where the data are processed by the Information Processing Division that provides ERBE and SAGE II experiment data to the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC).The second and third spacecraft launched with ERBE instruments are Television Infrared Radiometer Orbiting Satellite (TIROS) N-class spacecraft, which are part of the NOAA operational meteorological satellite series. The NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 spacecraft were launched in December 1984 and September 1986, respectively. The NOAA spacecraft include other instruments, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS), which provide NOAA with data for near-real-time weather forecasting. Both spacecraft are in nearly Sun-synchronous orbits. At launch equator-crossing times for the NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 orbits were 1420 UT (ascending) and 1930 UT (descending), respectively, where UT denotes universal time. The Satellite Operations and Control Center (SOCC) at the National Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service (NESDIS) operates the NOAA spacecraft. NOAA provides telemetry data and generates ERBE data for LaRC.From 1984 through 1994, total solar irradiance values were obtained from the solar monitor on the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) nonscanner.The individual total solar irradiance values represent orbital averages of the instantaneous measurements which are corrected for the angle between the instrument optical axis and the Sun and which are normalized to the mean Earth/Sun distance. At least once every 2 weeks, the Sun is observed by the monitor for several 64-second measurement intervals. Each interval is separated into two 32-second periods. During the first period, the Sun drifts across the9.2-degree unocculted field of view, and its radiation field is measured. During the second period, a low-emittance shutter, representative of a near-zero irradiance source, is cycled into the field of view, and the low irradiance from the back of the shutter is measured. The resulting measurements from the two different periods are used to define the irradiance, using the model that is described in Characteristics of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment Solar Monitors by R. B. Lee III, B. R. Barkstrom, and R. D. Cess. Typically, two to eight values of the irradiance are determined during an orbit.

We propose to obtain this data in a single flight in spring 2021 corresponding to the time scale when the next generation ground-based instruments will be completing their initial surveys.BFORE's combination of frequency coverage, sky coverage and angular resolution enables a range of science goals. The combination of BFORE and existing low frequency survey data from WMAP, PLANCK and ground-based experiments will enable an improved measurement of the optical depth to recombination, tau, constrain models of reionization and enable precise measurements of the neutrino masses. BFORE will also characterize the properties of the dust polarization with a precision sufficient to clean lower frequency B-mode polarization data to a level corresponding to a tensor to scalar ratio of r < 0.01. In addition, the combination of the frequency coverage and angular resolution of BFORE will enable peculiar velocity measurements or constraints on thousands of galaxy clusters, opening a new window into the evolution of large scale structure. Finally, by probing the dust polarization in the diffuse Interstellar Medium (ISM), BFORE will examine the role the magnetic fields play in the formation of stars and large-scale filaments in our Galaxy.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        arizona-state-unive...",NA,NA
"1416","Measurement and Modeling of Surface Coking in Fuel-Film Cooled Liquid Rocket Engines","The development of future Kerosone/LOX engines will require higher chamber pressures to increase performance and reusability in order to decrease operating costs. However higher chamber pressures result in higher heat fluxes through the walls. This places greater stress on the cooling systems. Fuel film cooling is an effective method to reduce the heat flux, however since the fuel is not combusted, it reduces performance of the engine. Furthermore, an issue with using kerosene as coolant is coking that results from the thermal decomposition of the propellant. This decreases heat transfer and reduces the lifespan of the chamber material. This process has been previously studied in regenerative cooled chambers but the mechanisms for coke formation have not been well established. Additionally, in a fuel filmed cooled chamber the process is much more complicated with coking resulting from interactions with the liquid film and gaseous core flow. Currently the only models that exist for coking have been developed for the chemical and petroleum industries. The conditions inside a rocket combustion chamber however are much more severe and extrapolation of existing models will result in large error. Therefore coking models for rocket conditions are in need of development. For this project, an experimental and computational approach is proposed to understand the coking phenomena at rocket conditions. Experiments will be done to study coking behavior in a heated pipe reactor for the liquid fuel and for combusted gaseous products. SEM and an x-ray elemental detection analysis will be performed to determine the chemical characteristics of the coke layer. The results will be compared with another experiment that will involve coking in a liquid fuel film and gaseous core flow environment. Existing coke models will be modified to match the data at the higher pressure and temperature conditions from the experimental results. The end result would be an experimentally validated coking model that would serve to aid in the design of future reusable liquid booster engines and advance NASA's Launch Propulsion Systems Technology Roadmap.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        purdue-university",NA,NA
"1417","On-Line Flutter Prediction Tool for Wind Tunnel Flutter Testing using Parameter Varying Estimation Methodology, Phase II","ZONA Technology, Inc. (ZONA) proposes to develop an on-line flutter prediction tool using the parameter varying estimation (PVE) methodology, called the PVE Toolbox, to ensure the flight safety during the flight flutter test and to prevent the damage to the wind tunnel hardware from the structural failure of the flutter model during wind tunnel flutter test. This tool can be applied to rapidly identify parameters, such as modal damping and frequency from test data measured at pre-flutter flight/wind tunnel conditions, then subsequently to assess the flutter boundary of aircraft/wind tunnel model in real time. In this PVE Toolbox, several system identification techniques are employed to consistently estimate the damping/frequency of the physical modes, followed by the implementation of Zimmerman-Weissenburger flutter margin, damping trends extrapolation, linear parameter varying modeling combined with mu-analysis, and thin plate interpolation method for flutter boundary prediction.  Seamlessly integration of the PVE Toolbox into IADS (a real-time flight test data acquisition software system) will significantly improve the on-line flutter prediction capability of the PVE Toolbox.  This robust, production-ready, and flight test demonstrated PVE Toolbox will provide flight/wind tunnel test engineers an on-line flutter prediction capability in the control room for decision-making during flight/wind tunnel flutter tests.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        dryden-flight-resea...",NA,NA

The goal of TARM is to increase the efficiency with which capacity-limited transition fixes connecting the enroute and terminal airspaces are used in both clear and disruptive weather conditions, by proactively suggesting reroutes to balance arrival and departure demand across available fixes, relative to capacity, and temporarily reallocating fixes between arrivals and departures when extreme demand or weather conditions warrant.  TARM uses stochastic weather and capacity forecasts.  The TARM concept represents an important step toward Trajectory Based Operations by integrating a traffic management decision with individual flight trajectories, and applying a TBO paradigm in which arrival and departure flights are separated by trajectory rather than procedural airspace regions.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        ames-research-center",NA,NA

"1422","Multi-Parameter Measurement in Unseeded Flows using Femtosecond Lasers (Tier 1)","Measurements in NASA's wind tunnels generally consist of force and moment and on-body measurements like surface pressure, surface deflection or heat transfer to the surface.  Detailed off-body measurements are needed to understand complex wind tunnel flows and to provide data to validate high-fidelity computational models. Most existing techniques capable of measuring detailed off-body flows, for example, particle image velocimetry, require particle or gas seeding which is not possible in many of NASA's tunnels. In this project, two techniques utilizing new femtosecond laser technology will be investigated. Both techniques show promise of measuring multiple parameters quantitatively in unseeded wind tunnel flows. The femtosecond laser electronic excitation and tagging (FLEET) technique can measure velocity and potentially pressure and temperature simultaneously. The femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (FS-CARS) technique can measure pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The two techniques have relative advantages and limitations that will be explored.  The objective of this research project is to leverage recent advancements in laser technology and recent discoveries in academia to discover and apply new ways of measuring aerospace flows. In particular, methods of measuring the gas velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration will be developed. The two different measurement techniques share a common femtosecond laser technology and can be used separately or together to measure multiple gas properties simultaneously in wind tunnel flows and possibly in flight. In this project, we are extending the ability of FLEET to measure multiple parameters such as pressure and temperature simultaneous with velocity.  These additional parameters will be obtained by observing and interpreting the amplitude and spectrum of the FLEET signal.  The main novelty of the proposed work is that FLEET should allow velocity to be measured in several facilities where velocity cannot be curren","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

"1424","High Effectiveness Heat Exchanger for Cryogenic Refrigerators, Phase I","We propose an innovative high performance cryogenic heat exchanger manufactured of titanium by photo-etching and diffusion bonding. This is a parallel plate design of thin laminated titanium foils. Titanium is used because of it low thermal conductivity which allows more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic heat loss. Photo-etched patterns in the foils create the flow passages for the hot and cold flows with solid barrier foils separating the streams. A difficult problem with high performance heat exchangers is balancing the mass flow rate between multiple flow passages required for all but the smallest levels of cooling; this problem can degrade exchanger ineffectiveness by factors of more then 3. Our manufacturing technique allows us to include flow balancing features within the flow passages to automatically balance the flow rates. Recuperative cycle cryocoolers, such as reverse Brayton, Joule-Thomson or their hybrids, require high effectiveness heat exchangers to reach cryogenic temperatures. Higher effectiveness leads directly to improved system efficiency or allows lower temperatures to be reached. Improved heat exchanger performance will directly lead to lower input power cryocoolers particularly for the 4-10 K temperature range where cryocooler system efficiencies are very low.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

Based on our experience with the MIDN development, we designed and developed an advanced version of the instrument. 2. A prototype was developed that although did not include all of the specifications was able to achieve with a 10 um thick sensor a dE/dx ~ 3 keV/um in silicon that is equivalent to a lineal energy of ~1 keV/um in tissue. BENCHTOP DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 1. By designing and constructing a new Faraday cage that houses the sensor and preamplifier circuit, upgrading the signal transmission circuitry between the system and the data acquisition area, and designing a new data acquisition method, we were able to reduce the inherent noise level well below a keV/micron, allowing detection of the peak of the dose distributions for minimum ionizing protons, the most difficult particles to detect microdosimetrically. 2. In collaboration with the M. Sivertz and A. Rusek at BNL, we have developed a system that allows identification of incident particles, categorized them according to their mass-to-charge ratio and energy, and correlated them with individual events in the microdosimeter. Recall that our earlier work in this regard resulted in our identifying lighter ion contaminants in the beam and their contributions to the microdosimetric spectra, a fact that we subsequently learned was known to BNL personnel. 3. We measured the energy deposited in a microdosimeter with radiation beams of Carbon at 290 MeV/n and protons at 1 GeV/n, 600 MeV/n, 250 MeV/n, 100 MeV/n, and 50 MeV/n at the NSRL facility at the BNL and achieved a lower energy cutoff of < 1 keV/um in silicon equivalent to a lineal energy cutoff in tissue of < 0.3 keV/um. ADVANCED SENSOR DEVELOPMENT 1. We now have prototypes of a new design of a solid-state microdosimeter with three dimension micron sized sensitive volumes, addressing some of the shortcomings identified earlier. This sensor was developed at the Centre for Medical Research Physics, and a new grant (Australian Research Council Discovery Project) was recently received by our collaborator to further support this project. 2. We have established collaborations with the EE (electrical engineering) departments at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) to explore the potential of developing alternative silicon sensors. These new sensors will be developed as part of our follow-on grant from the NSBRI. 3. With minimal support, JHU was able to supply us with two dies that have a variety of diodes for preliminary testing. A test fixture was developed to carry out tests, and measurements of alpha particles were successfully conducted. RADIATION TRANSPORT CODES 1. We imported the radiation transport code GEANT4 and two corollary programs MULASSIS (multilayered shielding simulation software tool) and GEMAT.

"1428","Radiation and High Temperature Tolerant GaN Power Electronics, Phase I","Power electronic components with high operating voltages are desirable in NASA Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) systems since they can lead to reduced mass and higher efficiency at the system architecture level, and serve as an enabling technology for solar electric propulsion systems. Gallium nitride (GaN) offers significant advantages over silicon (Si) technologies for power applications including higher breakdown voltage and power density, rapid switching, lower switching losses, and higher temperature tolerance. Enhancement mode GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are a rapidly advancing technology that are scalable with voltage, offer superior electrical performance, and also demonstrate high tolerance to displacement damage and total ionizing dose (TID). However, prior tests have shown that heavy ion (HI) induced leakage currents and catastrophic damage may occur well below rated voltages. A thorough investigation of the HI response of emerging, higher voltage GaN HEMTs and underlying mechanisms is essential to develop radiation tolerant devices for space applications. CFDRC, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and EPC, proposes to use an integrated experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In Phase I, we will perform heavy ion testing of commercial EPC GaN HEMTs to generate response data. Detailed TCAD models will be developed for the HEMT structure to investigate physical mechanisms behind measured radiation response. In Phase II, we will perform additional heavy ion and TID testing as a function of temperature and bias. Extensive TCAD and higher-fidelity modeling will be performed to determine radiation and temperature-dependent mechanisms, and to investigate device design modifications for improved radiation tolerance. Promising solutions will be prototyped and characterized via testing. Participation by EPC in Phase II and beyond will ensure advanced space-qualified, GaN power devices.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"1429","Novel Hemispherical Scanner for a Coherent Fiber LIDAR System, Phase II","LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) systems have proven their value in the remote measurement of spatially resolved atmospheric wind velocities in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, aircraft wake vortices, and microbursts.  The capacity of coherent LIDAR systems to produce a continuous, real-time 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of the Mie backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions and at stand-off distances of up to 50 km at relatively low pulse energy gives this technology a clear advantage over other atmospheric monitoring technologies.SIBELLOPTICS proposed and successfully executed on a Phase I SBIR contract whose purpose was to design, build, and test a novel hemispherical scanner as part of a compact all-fiber coherent wind LIDAR sensor.  Activities included detailed drawings, procurement of the custom opto-mechanical materials, and build and test of the scanner assembly and controller.During the execution of contract NNX11CG86P SIBELLOPTICS designed, procured, and assembled the key components of the hemispherical scanner and controller and tested the assembly for operation with the control computer, repeatability of positioning, accuracy of pointing, and azimuth and elevation load endurance.In Phase II, it is proposed that, based upon findings and testing during Phase I efforts, the full hemispherical scanner system be designed, built, and tested using a computer-based controller that operates with an interactive, user-selected interface menu.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA
"1430","Detectors with Improved Near-to-Mid IR Performance and Reduced Cooling Requirements, Phase I","This STTR Phase I proposal addresses a NASA need for improved near-to-mid IR detectors for imaging and spectroscopy. High performance IR detectors with cutoff wavelengths in the range of 2.5  5.0 microns will be developed using InGaAs / AlAsSb semiconductor materials. The proposal uses a two-pronged approach to address the problem of detector performance degradation by materials' defects, both ""grown in"" defects and defects caused by radiation damage. The project will apply an advanced device architecture, the nBn detector, which has been shown to be extremely successful in other IR detectors for suppression of defect-related dark current and noise. Additionally, the project will apply our proprietary defect mitigation technology, which passivates defects via UV hydrogenation treatments. The result of this program will be near-to-mid IR detectors with higher performance, reduced cooling requirements, and improved radiation hardness.These detectors are compatible with integration into mega-pixel IR imaging arrays for imaging 2.5  5.0 micron wavelengths with improved performance and reduced cost, which will be produced in Phase II.Amethyst has teamed with the University of Oklahoma and FLIR Systems to ensure that this technology can be readily transitioned to meet NASA mission requirements.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

The proposed capability, Emissions and Noise Total Impact REduction (ENTIRE) is innovative in the follow ways:1.  It spans the spectrum of environmental impacts, encompassing both noise and local air-quality; 2.  It conjoins both ATM and aircraft-based activities for the management of these impact; and3.  It provides a tractable algorithmic approach to achieving specific noise and emissions impact reduction goals.The proposed capability directly supports the next-generation capabilities and environmentally friendly ATM capability sought under Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Subtopic A3.01 ? Next Generation ATM Systems, directly addressing integrated ATM/aircraft systems that reduce noise and emissions.  This software system enables NASA to provide quantitative techniques for finding ATM/aircraft operations that achieve specific combined noise and emissions impact reductions using methods that identify relative contributions of each aspect of ATM and aircraft operations to these reductions. At its core the system will utilize greedy/breedy algorithms with variance in degrees of freedom and comparison of subsequent solutions towards meeting specific impact reduction goals.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA
"1434","The Conductive Thermal Control Material Systems for Space Applications, Phase I","This proposal is submitted to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of processing the space environment stable, multifunctional thermal control material system (TCMS) that can be applied to space hardware and can enables the hardware to carry higher leakage current through engineering the high electrical conductivity. An innovative space environmental stable TCMS is suggested through research & development work for the multifunctional, low (αS/εT) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost effective, reliable manner. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of born nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh (BNNT-BNNMTM) and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various homologous compounds of Zinco-Indates that are recently identified as the high conductivity compounds with high refractive index. The material system that integrates these two technologies can allow higher leakage currents that may also help to defend against the natural solar storm events. The suggested TCMS have been derived from the available mathematical models for space craft charging that pay attention to the individual charge dissipation mechanisms and the molecular dynamics of the material systems as well as its thermodynamics. Thus the envisioned derived material systems can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond. The reliability goal for the multifunctional conductive TCMS is to have a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, and we anticipate the developments to mature by end of phase II ready for the hardware demonstration.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

"1446","The National Artificial Intelligence Research And Development Strategic Plan","Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits, the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address. This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI. Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems. Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2: Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce, consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NCO NITRD","artificial-intellig...                        development                        national                        nitrd                        nitrd-program                        plan                        research                        strategic","public",NA

Consequently, PCAST has called upon federal research agencies to create a multi-agency initiative focused on developing scientific and engineering foundations for protecting privacy, which could then be the basis for new technologies and solutions in this space. In August 2013 and in February 2014, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued two Requests For Information (RFI) to NITRD on privacy research activities pursued by the agencies in NITRD, to understand what research is taking place, and to explore a possible multi-agency research agenda in foundations of privacy.

"1526","Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Historical Annual Data: 1975 - 2000","The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. ""Covered"" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI. Industry level data from  1975 to 2000 is reflective of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","State of New York","employment                        industry                        labor-statistics                        payroll                        sic                        wages","public",NA

QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. ""Covered"" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","State of New York","employment                        industry                        labor-statistics                        payroll","public",NA

"1618","Vehicle-Level Reasoning Systems:  Integrating System-Wide data to Estimate Instantaneous Health State","One of the primary goals of Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) is to detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events during the flight of an aircraft, regardless of the subsystem(s) from which the adverse event arises. To properly address this problem, it is critical to develop technologies that can integrate large, heterogeneous (meaning that they contain both continuous and discrete signals), asynchronous data streams from multiple subsystems in order to detect a potential adverse event, diagnose its cause, predict the effect of that event on the remaining useful life of the vehicle, and then take appropriate steps to mitigate the event if warranted. These data streams may have highly non-Gaussian distributions and can also contain discrete signals such as caution and warning messages which exhibit non-stationary and obey arbitrary noise models. At the aircraft level, a Vehicle-Level Reasoning System (VLRS) can be developed to provide aircraft with at least two significant capabilities:  improvement of aircraft safety due to enhanced monitoring and reasoning about the aircraft’s health state, and also potential cost savings through Condition Based Maintenance (CBM).  Along with the achieving the benefits of CBM, an important challenge facing aviation safety today is safeguarding against system- and component-level failures and malfunctions.Citation:  A. N.

Creare has developed flexible radiators that are extremely lightweight, stowable in small volumes, and deployable with small forces, but are limited by materials to temperatures below 350 K. These novel radiators incorporate integral micrometeorite protection.  Our innovation is a material combination and fabrication method that produces radiator panels with low weight, high fin efficiency, and excellent strength at temperatures.  Our goal is to provide a radiator technology based on prior technologies and provides a major advancement toward NASA's goals for light weight and high temperature operation in advanced radiators.  The innovative approach does not require development of new materials, simply refinement of processes to join standard metal tubes and foils in the configuration desired.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of the concept and demonstrated the ability of the panel to operate at high temperature.  Our lightweight radiator panel offers a factor of four reduction in weight compared with present honeycomb structures and will approach 1.5 kg/m? at a fin efficiency approaching 80%.  During Phase II we propose to build, test, and deliver an subscale radiator that demonstrates the advantages of the technology.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

"1623","Compact, Low Current Superconductor Coil Operating Above 15 K for Magnetic Cooling, Phase I","Adiabatic Magnetic Refrigeration (ADR) can achieve much better efficiency, and with fewer moving parts than compressor-refrigerators, making it the choice for space-based instruments that require cooling to the sub-Kelvin range. The low operating currents required for space-based usage, the high operating current densities to keep weight and size down, as well as the benefits of higher operating temperature provided by our “2212” superconductor are unmatched by any other superconducting wire option for powering the ADR’s magnet. The innovation in this program consists of a compact, low current coil wound with a novel, very fine 2212 wire, that operates at about 6 A or lower, that generates in excess of 4 T and that operates at up to 25K (not 10K) with low hysteresis losses in ramped fields, very considerably exceeding the specifications in the guideline put forward by NASA, and exceeding even more so, present state-of-the-art ADR coil capabilities. As a first step, the prototype 2212-based fine wire will be designed and fabricated, with process development to achieve the above described properties. Based on these results, longer length prototype sections will be produced at best design and mode conditions, followed by testing to validate scalability. As a final step, a subscale test coil will be wound and tested with same bore size as the current, low temperature superconductor-based coils, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating an ADR- type of coil with this wire.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

The Level 2B wind vectors are binned on a 12.5 km Wind Vector Cell (WVC) grid and processed using the Level 2A Sigma-0 dataset. RapidScat is a Ku-band dual beam circular rotating scatterometer retaining much of the same hardware and functionality of QuikSCAT, with exception of the antenna sub-system and digital interface to the International Space Station (ISS) Columbus module, which is where RapidScat is mounted. The NASA mission is officially referred to as ISS-RapidScat. Unlike QuikSCAT, ISS-RapidScat is not in sun-synchronous orbit, and flies at roughly half the altitude with a low inclination angle that restricts data coverage to the tropics and mid-latitude regions; the extent of latitudinal coverage stretches from approximately 61 degrees North to 61 degrees South. Furthermore, there is no consistent local time of day retrieval. This dataset is provided in a netCDF-3 file format that follows the netCDF-4 classic model (i.e., generated by the netCDF-4 API) and made available via FTP and OPeNDAP. For data access, please click on the ""Data Access"" tab above. This Version 1.2 dataset differs from the previous Version 1.1 dataset as follows: 1) L1B sigma-0 has been re-calibrated during the periods of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 2) during low SNR periods the L1B sigma-0 calibration is determined using re-pointed L1B QuikSCAT data. It is advised for users to avoid using the ""wind_obj"" variable in this dataset since it is minimally applicable and meant primarily for quality assurance; for users who wish to access the objective function values for each ambiguity, it is suggested to use only the ""ambiguity_obj"" variable. The ""wind_obj"" variable contains DIRTH probabilities (which are derived form the ""ambiguity_obj"" objective function values) in the range of 0 to 1 indicating the conditional probability that the true direction is within + or - 2.5 degrees of the retrieved wind direction given the observed backscatter measurements in the cell.

The simulated daily VWC values are also provided in the file with the measured VWC. For comparison, results of VWC simulation for the control and treatment plots using a STELLA model which incorporates rainfall and plant water uptake are provided. There are two ASCII comma delimited files of simulated results. See Belk et. al., 2007 for details.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","biosphere                        earth-science                        ecosystems","public",NA
"1626","HELIX: The High Energy Light Isotope Experiment at NKU","This is the Northern Kentucky University (NKU) proposal (lead: Scott Wakely, University of Chicago) for a new suborbital program, HELIX (High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment), designed to make measurements of the isotopic composition of light cosmic ray nuclei from ~200 MeV/nuc to ~10 GeV/nuc. Past measurements of this kind have provided profound insights into the nature and origin of cosmic rays, revealing, for instance, information on acceleration and confinement time scales, and exposing some conspicuous discrepancies between solar and cosmic-ray abundances. The most detailed information currently available comes from the ACE/CRIS mission, but is restricted to energies below a few 100 MeV/nuc. HELIX aims at extending this energy range by over an order of magnitude, to energies where, in many cases, no measurements of any kind exist. The HELIX measurements will provide essential information for understanding the propagation history of cosmic rays in the galaxy. This is a crucial element for properly interpreting several intriguing anomalies reported in recent cosmic-ray measurements, pertaining to the energy spectra of protons, helium, and heavier nuclei, and perhaps most strikingly, to the anomalous rise in the positron fraction at higher energy.HELIX employs a high-precision magnet spectrometer to provide measurements which are not achievable by any current or proposed instrument. The detector system will incorporate the existing superconducting magnet constructed for the HEAT payload, which has successfully operated on five previous high-altitude campaigns.  This magnet will be combined with state-of-the-art detectors to measure the charge, time-of-flight, magnetic rigidity, and velocity of cosmic-ray particles with high precision. Specifically, the instrument will combine plastic scintillators, a silicon-strip tracker with ~30 micron spatial resolution, a high-performance drift chamber, and a ring-imaging Cherenkov counter employing aerogel radiators.NKU will be responsible for fabricating the bottom time of flight detectors, instrument recovery preparations, and share simulations with UC and analysis with all.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA
"1627","HNX/DragonTIGER Instrument Development Project","<p>Precisely identifying the species of cosmic-ray nuclei detected by a satellite or balloon instrument requires the use of several complementary detector systems. In particular, determining the nuclear charge of an incident nucleus, and so the element to which it belongs, requires precise measurements of the differential energy loss of the particle passing through a well-characterized layer of material, the velocity of the particle, and its trajectory. The goal of this project is to improve detectors for these measurements.</p>","http://techport.nasa.gov/fetchFile?objectId=6561","http://techport.nasa.gov/fetchFile?objectId=3456","N/A","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...                        project",NA,NA
"1628","An Event-based Distributed Diagnosis Framework using Structural Model Decomposition","Complex engineering systems require efficient on-line fault diagnosis methodologies to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs. Traditionally, diagnosis approaches are centralized, but these solutions do not scale well. Also, centralized diagnosis solutions are difficult to implement on increasingly prevalent distributed, networked embedded systems. This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework for physical systems with continuous behavior. Using Possible Conflicts, a structural model decomposition method from the Artificial Intelligence model-based diagnosis (DX) community, we develop a distributed diagnoser design algorithm to build local event-based diagnosers. These diagnosers are constructed based on global diagnosability analysis of the system, enabling them to generate local diagnosis results that are globally correct without the use of a centralized coordinator. We also use Possible Conflicts to design local parameter estimators that are integrated with the local diagnosers to form a comprehensive distributed diagnosis framework. Hence, this is a fully distributed approach to fault detection, isolation, and identification. We evaluate the developed scheme on a four-wheeled rover for different design scenarios to show the advantages of using Possible Conflicts, and generate on-line diagnosis results in simulation to demonstrate the approach.","November 12, 2020","irregular","Dashlink","ames                        dashlink                        nasa",NA,NA

At this workshop, Federal, private, and academic stakeholders discussed their individual views regarding the need for innovation in radio receiver systems. This workshop report outlines research topics that were discussed by a cross-section of experts with the goal of improving radio receiver systems. Past efforts to achieve better performance and more efficient spectrum use have focused on frequency-division and time-division allocations, but the explosion of wireless data service applications is driving the need for innovative changes in modern radio systems. Many systems are moving to wideband performance characteristics to increase their capabilities and performance. This reliance on wideband spectrum in the lower spectrum bands and the high-frequency millimeter wave bands requires designing and developing radio systems with increased functionality in both the transmitters and receivers. Improving overall system performance depends heavily on receivers being designed and built to deal with increased spectrum congestion and interference. Receiver design also needs to consider the full radio system to fully characterize and quantify performance. Upfront system engineering is needed for improved coexistence approaches that reduce overall interference. In addition, designers must balance performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, selectivity, and efficiency) against costs, and policymakers must find ways to facilitate improved performance and information exchange that is both secure and private...","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NCO NITRD","design                        development                        improve                        information                        innovation                        interference                        needs                        performance                        policy                        radio                        receiver","public",NA

What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER BEFORE USING DATA. To reduce the energy burden on income-qualified households within New York State, NYSERDA offers the EmPower New York (EmPower) program, a retrofit program that provides cost-effective electric reduction measures (i.e., primarily lighting and refrigerator replacements), and cost-effective home performance measures (i.e., insulation air sealing, heating system repair and replacments, and health and safety measures) to income qualified homeowners and renters. Home assessments and implementation services are provided by Building Performance Institute (BPI) Goldstar contractors to reduce energy use for low income households. This data set includes energy efficiency projects completed since January 2018 for households with income up to 60% area (county) median income.D I S C L A I M E R: Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, and First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate represent contractor reported savings derived from energy modeling software calculations and not actual realized energy savings. The accuracy of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings for projects has been evaluated by an independent third party. The results of the impact analysis indicate that, on average, actual savings amount to 54 percent of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and 70 percent of the Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings. The analysis did not evaluate every single project, but rather a sample of projects from 2007 and 2008, so the results are applicable to the population on average but not necessarily to any individual project which could have over or under achieved in comparison to the evaluated savings. The results from the impact analysis will be updated when more recent information is available. Some reasons individual households may realize savings different from those projected include, but are not limited to, changes in the number or needs of household members, changes in occupancy schedules, changes in energy usage behaviors, changes to appliances and electronics installed in the home, and beginning or ending a home business.

Each state designates ‘areas of chronic economic distress’ with the approval of the US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). SONYMA identifies its target areas using US Census Bureau census tracts and block numbering areas. Both census tracts and block numbering areas subdivide individual counties. SONYMA also relates each of its single-family mortgages to a specific census tract or block numbering area.New York State identifies ‘areas of chronic economic distress’ using census tract numbers. 26 US Code § 143 (current through Pub. L. 114-38) defines the criteria that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development uses in approving designations of ‘areas of chronic economic distress’ as: i) the condition of the housing stock, including the age of the housing and the number of abandoned and substandard residential units, (ii) the need of area residents for owner-financing under this section, as indicated by low per capita income, a high percentage of families in poverty, a high number of welfare recipients, and high unemployment rates, (iii) the potential for use of owner-financing under this section to improve housing conditions in the area, and (iv) the existence of a housing assistance plan which provides a displacement program and a public improvements and services program.The US Census Bureau’s decennial census last took place in 2010 and will take place again in 2020.

"1807","CAMP2Ex P-3 In-Situ Cloud Data","CAMP2Ex_Cloud_AircraftInSitu_P3_Data are in-situ cloud measurements conducted onboard the P-3 aircraft during the Clouds, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes-Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex). CAMP2Ex was a NASA field study, with three main science objectives: aerosol effect on cloud microphysical and optical properties, aerosol and cloud influence on radiation as well as radiative feedback, and meteorology effect on aerosol distribution and aerosol-cloud interactions. Research on these three main objectives requires a comprehensive characterization of aerosol, cloud, and precipitation properties, as well as the associated meteorological and radiative parameters. Trace gas tracers are also needed for airmass type analysis to characterize the role of anthropogenic and natural aerosols. To deliver these observations, CAMP2Ex utilized a combination of remote sensing and in-situ measurements. NASA’s P-3B aircraft was equipped with a suite of in-situ instruments to conduct measurements of aerosol and cloud properties, trace gases, meteorological parameters, and radiative fluxes. The P-3B was also equipped passive remote sensors (i.e. lidar, polarimeter, radar, and radiometers). A second aircraft, the SPEC Learjet 35A, was primarily dedicated to measuring detailed cloud microphysical properties. The sampling strategy designed for CAMP2Ex coordinated flight plans for both aircraft to maximize the science return. The P-3B was used primarily to conduct remote sensing measurements of cloud and precipitation structure and aerosol layers and vertical profiles of atmospheric state variable, while the Learjet flew below the P-3B to obtain the detailed cloud microphysical properties. During the 2019 field deployment in the vicinity of the Philippines, completed from August 20-October 10, the P-3B conducted 19 science flights and the SPEC Learjet conducted 11 flights. Ground-based aerosol observations were also recorded in 2018 and 2019. CAMP2Ex was completed in partnership with Philippine research and operational weather communities. Measurements completed during CAMP2EX provide a 4-D observational view of the environment of the Philippines and its neighboring waters in terms of microphysical, hydrological, dynamical, thermodynamical and radiative properties of the environment, targeting the environment of shallow cumulus and cumulus congestus clouds.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC","atmosphere                        clouds                        earth-science","public",NA
"1808","ICE SOLAR WIND PLASMA ELECTRON ANALYSER DATA V1.0","These data were obtained from the LANL plasma experiment on ICE (Principal Investigator: S.J. Bame assistance from K. Sofaly and S. Kedge). The instrument measures the 2-D electron distribution function in one spacecraft rotation (3 s) once every 24 s, by obtaining 16 evenly spaced energy spectra, each with 15 contiguous levels covering the energy range 8.5 eV to 1140 eV. From these 2-D distributions the density, velocity, and temperature of the electrons are then derived. A 2-D temperature matrix is calculated which is subsequently diagonalized. Then nominally the maximum temperature corresponds to the parallel temperature and the minimum temperature corresponds to the perpendicular temperature. This is done independently of the magnetic field measurements however, the direction of maximum temperature determined in this manner is usually found to be within 15 degrees of the magnetic field direction inferred from the magnetometer measurements. The time resolution is 24 sec from the start of Day 253 (September 10) until Day 255 (September 12), 18:38.

"1809","Passively-Coded Embedded Wideband Microwave Sensors for Material Characterization and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)","Materials and structures are constantly subject to fatigue and degradation, and monitoring and maintaining civil, space, and aerospace infrastructure is an ongoing critical issue facing our society today. As new materials, such as complex multilayer composites, come into wider use, the need to monitor them is also rapidly growing. Space exploration adds to this need by offering extreme conditions and increased risk associated with material failure. The proposed research seeks to tackle this problem by developing passively-coded miniature embedded wideband microwave sensors, exploring their applicability, and investigating the utility of a novel and unique methodology for inspecting materials and complex structures. Each sensor will consist of a miniaturized wideband antenna specifically designed to have a number of resonances in its reflection property. By using the reflection properties of the antenna, regions in frequency of resonance and reflection can be associated with 0s and 1s to create a specific ""code"" for that antenna. This code shifts (in frequency) or alters based on the properties and degradation of the material in which the antenna is embedded. These sensors could be embedded in materials and structures such as concrete, a composite fuselage, or an astronaut's planetary habitat, and by being passive, the sensors will not need to be energized (i.e., wired in or provided with a power source). In the case of a planetary habitat, an astronaut could easily inspect their home for damage using a simple transceiver, and perform repairs or preventative maintenance if necessary. This practice would increase the astronaut's safety and minimize the risk of structure failure while they explore and are faced with the unforgiving environment of space. Because this technology is of such a low TRL nature, its full application range cannot be conceptualized at this point. However, with their low cost nature and versatility, these sensors have the potential to be integrated into many space structures and materials as well as everyday civil and aerospace structures like bridges, parking garages, and planes. Additionally, the sensor data could be used to refine manufacturing processes. This research will be pursued as part of an electrical engineering MS degree at Missouri S&T under the guidance of Dr. Reza Zoughi and the tools needed to engage in this research will be primarily provided through the Applied Microwave and Nondestructive Testing Laboratory (amntl) on campus.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        missouri-university...",NA,NA
"1810","Compact Kinetic Mechanisms for Petroleum-Derived and Alternative Aviation Fuels, Phase I","To be useful for computational combustor design and analysis using tools like the National Combustion Code (NCC), low-dimensional chemical kinetic mechanisms for modeling of real fuel combustion chemistry must be sufficiently compact so that they can be utilized in multi-dimensional, multi-physics, reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Despite advances in CFD-appropriate kinetic mechanism reduction for kerosene-range fuels, significant combustion property variation among current and prospective certified fuels remains a challenge for meaningful CFD-advised design of high pressure, low-emissions combustors. The proposed project will leverage Princeton's ongoing work in aviation fuel surrogate formulation and modeling as well as kinetic mechanism development for emissions and high pressure combustion to produce and demonstrate a meta-model framework for automated generation of fuel-flexible compact chemical kinetic mechanisms appropriate for 3-D combustion CFD codes. Phase I will demonstrate the novel meta-model approach by providing compact kinetic mechanisms for both a ""typical"" Jet A/JP-8 (POSF-4658), as well as a synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) derived from natural gas (POSF 4734). Phase II of this proposed work would generalize the Phase I results to span the combustion property parameter space relevant to both conventional and next-generation alternative aviation fuels.  The commercial product foreseen from this SBIR program is a stand-alone, novice-friendly real fuel kinetic mechanism generator software package that can interface with commercially-available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes.  Potential customers may include the companies supplying ANSYS, CFD-ACE+, or COMSOL, as well as industrial users with proprietary in-house codes.  Tools to yield compact real fuel kinetic models has similar broad appeal for computational simulations in  automotive, aerospace (both defense and civilian), and marine propulsion industries.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA
"1811","Fast Responding PSP for Rotorcraft Aerodynamic Investigations, Phase I","The proposed work focuses on implementing fast-response pressure-sensitive paint and Surface Stress Sensitive Films for measurements of unsteady pressure and skin friction in rotorcraft applications. Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Often these unsteady pressures are difficult to resolve in the rotating frame due to difficult installation of pressure transducers, and data is available only at discrete points. Pressure-sensitive paint formulations have been developed to provide surface pressure information in situations such as this, but conventional PSP formulations have slow response times. Conventional skin friction measurements, for example oil flow, do not offer significant frequency response. In order to improve the frequency response characteristics of PSP, sprayed porous paint binders have been developed for measurement of unsteady pressures. Fast-responding Surface Stress Sensitive Films provide both quantitative skin friction and qualitative flow visualization measurements. These techniques can provide high-spatial-resolution, time-resolved pressure and skin friction information that will provide unparalleled insight into the physical mechanisms driving certain rotorcraft problems. Both of these techniques will be demonstrated in Ohio State's unique 6""x22"" transonic wind tunnel, where an airfoil may be tested for dynamic stall simulation in compressible flow. Successful demonstration of fast-responding PSP and S3F on a dynamic stall test in the 6""x22"" tunnel will serve as a proof of concept that will allow transition of the technologies into larger-scale wind tunnels at NASA and elsewhere.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

This is a proposal to develop a space qualified high power, single mode, low noise and narrow linewidth fiber laser based on a""virtual ring"" laser cavity at the 1.06 micron spectral band. This novel laser architecture enables traveling-wave oscillation in a compact, linear and all-fiber cavity. This leads to unprecedented low noise and stable laser oscillator. The all fiber device also offers a highly reliable, compact and power conserving solution. We have already demonstrated virtual ring oscillators at the 1.55 micron band that rival the state of the ring laser architecture. In this research we will develop a 1.06 micron laser that can meet or exceed the LISA experiment required laser specifications.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"1816","FY 2012 Supplement to the President`s Budget","The yearly Supplement to the Presidents Budget for the NITRD Program is designed to present a succinct technical summary of the research activities planned and coordinated through NITRD in a given Federal budget cycle, as required by law. The Supplement is organized by PCA, to align with the structure of the Program. Every PCA section follows the same format, so that readers can quickly identify: The NITRD member agencies and participating agencies active in the PCA; The definition of the research covered in the PCA;The interagency strategic priorities in the PCA for the forthcoming fiscal year; Budget highlights ? agencies key RD programs and topical emphases in the PCA for the forthcoming year; Interagency coordination ? current and planned activities in which multiple agencies are collaborating; Ongoing core activities of each agency in the PCA; The NITRD Supplement also includes an annual budget table and budget analysis section, organized by PCA and by agency, to facilitate budgetary and programmatic comparisons from year to year.The Supplement itself is a product of NITRD coordination: The text is developed, revised, reviewed, and approved by the NITRD agencies in a collaborative process over a six-month period prior to the release of the Presidents budget. The process begins with an Annual Planning Meeting APM in each NITRD PCA. In these day-long gatherings, agency representatives present briefings summarizing their agencies IT research priorities, program plans, and current activities in the PCA. Following the briefings, the agencies discuss shared research issues and plan cooperative activities. The Supplements PCA sections are based on the APM discussions and subsequent refining of the text by the agencies. For example, the IWG and CG members review and update their PCAs definition statement and interagency R and D priorities to reflect evolution of key technologies and associated research challenges that agencies face in common. The agencies report on their collaborative efforts to address such challenges in the PCA subsection called Planning and Coordination Supporting Request.NITRD agencies engaged in R and D and coordination activities cited in the Supplement are listed in NITRD budget order, followed by the participating agencies. If there is a lead agency for the activity, that agency is listed first; agencies listed after the word with are in-kind contributors rather than funders or performers. Some large-scale activities may be cited in more than one PCA because they involve R and D efforts in a variety of technologies. In such cases, agencies report the portion of program funding in each relevant PCA.The President`s 2012 budget request for the NITRD Program is $3.866 billion; 2010 NITRD actual expenditures totaled $3.793 billion.

"1835","The Convergence of High Performance Computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning: Summary of the Big Data and High End Computing Interagency Working Groups Joint Workshop","The high performance computing (HPC) and big data (BD) communities traditionally have pursued independent trajectories in the world of computational science. HPC has been synonymous with modeling and simulation, and BD with ingesting and analyzing data from diverse sources, including from simulations. However, both communities are evolving in response to changing user needs and technological landscapes. Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) not only for data analytics but also for modeling and simulation; science-based simulations are increasingly relying on embedded ML models not only to interpret results from massive data outputs but also to steer computations. Science-based models are being combined with data-driven models to represent complex systems and phenomena. There also is an increasing need for real-time data analytics, which requires large-scale computations to be performed closer to the data and data infrastructures, to adapt to HPC-like modes of operation. These new use cases create a vital need for HPC and BD systems to deal with simulations and data analytics in a more unified fashion. To explore this need, the NITRD Big Data and High-End Computing R&D Interagency Working Groups held a workshop, The Convergence of High-Performance Computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning, on October 29-30, 2018, in Bethesda, Maryland. The purposes of the workshop were to bring together representatives from the public, private, and academic sectors to share their knowledge and insights on integrating HPC, BD, and ML systems and approaches and to identify key research challenges and opportunities. The 58 workshop participants represented a balanced cross-section of stakeholders involved in or impacted by this area of research.

"1875","Residential Existing Homes (One to Four Units) Energy Efficiency Projects with Income-based Incentives by Customer Type: Beginning 2010","IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER BEFORE USING DATA. The Residential Existing Homes Program is a market transformation program that uses Building Performance Institute (BPI) Goldstar contractors to install comprehensive energy-efficient improvements.  The program is designed to use building science and a whole-house approach to reduce energy use in the State’s existing one-to-four family and low-rise multifamily residential buildings and capture heating fuel and electricity-related savings.  The Program provides income-based incentives, including an assisted subsidy for households with income up to 80% of the State or Median County Income, whichever is higher to install eligible energy efficiency improvements including building shell measures, high efficiency heating and cooling measures, ENERGY STAR appliances and lighting.  D I S C L A I M E R: Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, and First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate represent contractor reported savings derived from energy modeling software calculations and not actual realized energy savings. The accuracy of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings for projects has been evaluated by an independent third party. The results of the impact analysis indicate that, on average, actual savings amount to 35 percent of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and 65 percent of the Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings. The analysis did not evaluate every single project, but rather a sample of projects from 2007 and 2008, so the results are applicable to the population on average but not necessarily to any individual project which could have over or under achieved in comparison to the evaluated savings. The results from the impact analysis will be updated when more recent information is available. Many factors influence the degree to which estimated savings are realized, including proper calibration of the savings model and the savings algorithms used in the modeling software. Some reasons individual households may realize savings different from those projected include, but are not limited to, changes in the number or needs of household members, changes in occupancy schedules, changes in energy usage behaviors, changes to appliances and electronics installed in the home, and beginning or ending a home business. Beginning November 2017, the Program requires the use of HPXML-compliant modeling software tools and data quality protocols have been implemented to more accurately project savings. For more information, please refer to the Evaluation Report published on NYSERDA’s website at:  http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Files/Publications/PPSER/Program-Evaluation/2012ContractorReports/2012-HPwES-Impact-Report-with-Appendices.pdf.  The New York Residential Existing Homes (One to Four Units) dataset includes the following data points for projects completed during Green Jobs Green-NY, beginning November 15, 2010: Home Performance Project ID, Home Performance Site ID, Project County, Project City, Project Zip, Gas Utility, Electric Utility, Project Completion Date, Customer Type, Low-Rise or Home Performance Indicator, Total Project Cost (USD), Total Incentives (USD), Type of Program Financing, Amount Financed Through Program (USD), Pre-Retrofit Home Heating Fuel Type, Year Home Built, Size of Home, Volume of Home, Number of Units, Measure Type, Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate (USD), Homeowner Received Green Jobs-Green NY Free/Reduced Cost Audit (Y/N).How does your organization use this dataset?

Engagement is defined as receiving two or more such services within 14 days of discharge and three or more lower level services within 30 days of discharge.The year 2015 saw the conclusion of the first phase of the Behavioral Health Organization initiative(BHO). A new Behavioral Health Managed Care Transition phase II is underway. The data contained inthe BHO metrics span 2010 to 2014, using the 2010 calendar year for a baseline. Earlier in the program(2011‐2012) the metrics were calculated quarterly and on a year‐to‐date basis, later in (2013‐2014),New York State Office of Mental Health opted for semi‐annual and year‐to‐date aggregations.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","State of New York","acute-care-discharges                        detoxification-reha...                        follow-up-treatments","public",NA

"1985","Multi-Element Lean Direct Injection Combustor Single Element Demonstration, Phase I","We propose to demonstrate the feasibility in a single element of a Multi-Element Lean Direct Injection, ME-LDI, Combustion concept.  The concept will have the following innovative features:1. Independent, mini burning zones created by containing the flame in a cylinder downstream of each fuel injector/swirler element in a multiple fuel injector array, see figure 1.  The independent burning zones will enable fuel staging the fuel injectors (turning off fuel to selected fuel injectors) to cover the operating cycle, such that at each point of the operating cycle the combustor will have high combustion efficiency (>99%) and low NOx emissions. At high power conditions the combustion efficiency should be greater than 99.9%.2. A plain-jet hypodermic fuel injector fuel injector will be incorporated into ME-LDI that is low cost and simple to manufacture but a highly effective atomizer.  Modified plain-jet fuel injectors will be studied including an injector with a tip that has a diverging nozzle and one that has a spin chamber at the exit.  These alternative plain-jet fuel injectors will increase the surface area at the exit of the injector resulting in a thinner film for better atomization and fuel-air mixing.3.

NASA has been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in support of these Earth science missions, but the current UAVs do not have sensor packages to make science quality measurements of parameters including three-dimensional wind, turbulence, temperature, humidity, and pressure.  AeroTech will develop 3-Dimensional Wind and Turbulence Measurement System for UAVs that is based on thermal anemometer technology and that will measure and resolve science quality wind vector and turbulence information throughout the flight envelope.  The System will provide high quality data that will improve NASA's ability to validate, verify, and supplement spaced-based measurements taken during missions.  Phase I will assess the capability of the thermal anemometer sensor portion of the system and finalize the system design.

Samples were collected from an approximately 20 x 20 m grid over each watershed from 2004/05/01 to 2004/08/18. By sampling each location at depths of 0-20 and 40-60 cm it was possible to distinguish and map the principle soil classes found in the study area to the 2nd category level of the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (Cooper et al., 2005) associated with the topographic relief. The data set contains one comma separated ASCII data file with spatially referenced soil nutrient and organic carbon data from 0-20 cm (A layer, topsoil) and 40-60 cm (B layer, subsoil)depths for the Juruena watersheds study area.A satisfactory relationship between the redness index of the diagnostic horizons and the soil class colors was also found. In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the visible landscape characteristics such as slope, soil color, and vegetation, the carbon and soil clay attributes were found to vary greatly. This variability over small distances demonstrates that extrapolation of soil characteristics and soil carbon stocks to larger areas could produce erroneous results if the spatial variability of the soil attributes is not taken into consideration.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","ORNL_DAAC","earth-science                        land-surface                        soils","public",NA

"1992","Blocking Filters with Enhanced Throughput for X-Ray Microcalorimetry, Phase II","NASA will fly x-ray microcalorimeters on several mission payloads scheduled within the next 5 years: New and improved IR/Visible blocking filters are urgently needed to realize the full potential and throughput of these missions. The innovation proposed, high transmission polyimide support mesh, will replace the nickel mesh used in previous blocking filter designs. Polyimide's composition affords high transparency to x-rays, especially above 3 keV. Phase 1 prototypes demonstrated 11-15% higher transmission than comparable nickel mesh across the UV-Visible-NIR range. With development of the Phase 1 process in Phase 2, the mesh will be optimized for strength, transmission, integration with filter materials, and filter lifetime; it will include deicing capability as required. Lithographic production means adaptability to meet future mission-specific filter performance requirements. The Phase 2 project will achieve a flight readiness level of 5-6 for blocking filters using the new mesh. Phase 1 results show that with successful process development, the proposed high transmission polyimide mesh will significantly improve mission throughput and effective area for microcalorimeter payloads on proposed NASA missions such as Spectrum-X-Gamma and NeXT in the near term as well as Constellation-X.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Firearm counts are derived from taking the number of violent crimes which involve a firearm. Population data are provided every year by the FBI, based on US Census information. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","State of New York","firearms                        index-crime                        public-safety                        ucr","public",NA

"2186","POLDER/Parasol L2 Radiation Budget subset along CloudSat track V001 (PARASOLRB_CPR) at GES DISC","This is the POLDER/Parasol Level-2 Radiation Budget Subset, collocated with the CloudSat track. The subset is processed at the A-Train Data Depot of the GES DISC, NASA. The algorithm first converts the original POLDER binary data, which is Level-2 but nevertheless in a sinusoidal grid, into HDF4 format, and thus stores the full-sized data in HDF4. Then, it calculates the CloudSat ground track coordinates, and proceeds to extract the closest POLDER grid cells. Along with the extraction, the algorithm re-orders the subset grid cells in a line-by-line fashion, so that the output subset is in array format and resembles a swath. This array has a cross-track dimension of 11 columns.  That makes about 200-km-wide coverage.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC","atmosphere                        atmospheric-radiation                        clouds                        earth-science                        national-geospatial...                        ngda","public",NA
"2187","Enhanced ORCA and CLARREO Depolarizers Using AR Microstructures, Phase I","Next generation Earth Science Satellites ORCA and CLARREO are designed to measure our planet's ocean and climate health.  Using hyper-spectral imaging at wavelengths ranging from the UV through NIR, these instruments will record the levels of the earth's temperature rise over the course of a decade.  To make such detailed measurements, polarization effects at various wavelengths due to multiple factors must be eliminated using an optical device known as a ""de-polarizer"".  For the CLARREO de-polarizer, four quartz windows are needed to randomize the polarization state of the observed reflected light spectrum.  Multiple reflections from 4 surfaces produce losses up to 14% of the incident light, a level high enough to produce ""ghost"" effects superimposed on the desired earth images resulting in reduced image contrast and greater measurement error.  An anti-reflection (AR) treatment is needed that can withstand the radiation and temperature effects caused by the mission environment while reducing reflection losses to levels of fractions of one percent.  A new type of AR treatment, being developed for many military and commercial applications, is based on surface relief microstructures fabricated directly in a window, optic, or sensor material.  AR microstructures (ARMs) can suppress internal reflections to levels unattainable by conventional thin-film AR coating technology.  To extend the performance benefits of ARMs to hyper-spectral imaging systems, it is proposed that the fabrication processes developed for fused silica, glass, silicon, and many other optical materials be adapted for use with the quartz and magnesium fluoride depolarizers planned for the ORCA and CLARREO missions.  In addition, an investigation of innovative surface microstructure technology is proposed for the fabrication of a new type of non-scattering, micro-textured depolarizer with inherent AR properties that can be applied to multiple optical elements within a spectrometer system.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"2188","Highly Accurate Sensor for High-Purity Oxygen Determination, Phase II","In this STTR effort, Los Gatos Research (LGR) and the University of Wisconsin (UW) propose to develop a highly-accurate sensor for high-purity oxygen determination.  The analyzer, which is based on LGR's patented Off-Axis ICOS technique, will be capable of rapidly quantifying high-purity oxygen (95  100 %) with very high accuracy (better than ? 0.03 %), minimal calibration, and no zero drift.  Moreover, the sensor will require no consumables and be sufficiently compact and robust for deployment aboard the International Space Station (ISS).In Phase I, LGR and UW successfully demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating a prototype that quantified high-purity oxygen with a precision of ? 0.017 % and a 24-hour drift of less than 0.05 %.  The analyzer distinguished a 0.1 % change in highly pure oxygen and provided a linear response (R2 = 0.999997) over a wide dynamic range (0  100 % oxygen).  The prototype was found to be accurate to 0.07 % by testing it at NASA Johnson Space Center on oxygen purified by the Cabin Air Separator for EVA Oxygen (CASEO) project.  Due to the success of this program, LGR released a commercial O2/CO2 analyzer for environmental applications.In Phase II, LGR and UW will refine the measurement strategy, miniaturize the hardware, ruggedize the analyzer, and test the resulting instrument.  The measurement strategy will be improved to reduce long-term drift and extended to include other species (H2O, O2 isotopes, N2).  The hardware will be modified to meet the technical requirements for deployment aboard the ISS (e.g. power, size, weight, and environmental specifications).  The prototype will be manufactured and tested to empirically determine its accuracy, precision, linearity, long-term drift, and time response.  Finally, the Phase II instrument will be delivered to researchers in the Life Support and Habitability Systems Branch at NASA Johnson Space Centers for characterization of high-purity oxygen generators.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        johnson-space-center",NA,NA
"2189","Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), Phase II","Sample return missions have primary importance in future planetary missions. A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Further development of the Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), is proposed after a successful Phase 1 program. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister incorporates features for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples  seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful Apollo indium knife edge seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent against contamination, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body can be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions. The prototype developed in Phase 1 demonstrated a leakage rate of less than 1e-6 cc-atm/s, meeting the primary science requirement.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA
"2190","A Constraint-Based Geospatial Data Integration System for Wildfire Management, Phase II","We propose to implement a constraint-based data integration system for wildfire intelligence, for use during both the pre-planning and event response phases of wildfire fighting.  Our system will automatically integrate online, heterogeneous data sources and hyperspectral imagery.  Current technology tends to focus mostly on the event response phases and supports only limited types of integration, usually between structured databases.  With the emergence of the Internet, there now exists an enormous number of other online information sources that can be combined with local databases and satellite imagery, including NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products, in order to better assist human analysis.  In this Phase II proposal, we will implement the constraint-based data integration system for wildfire intelligence that we designed in Phase I. The system will allow users  to manage large amounts of data from heterogeneous sources using a single interface, to annotate and extend that data (to add a layer of ""knowledge"" on top of the data), as well as to quickly identify data updates.  The resulting application will complement existing technologies, and serve as a rich, integrated interface that allows one to more easily and quickly plan for, analyze, and react to wildfires.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","ames-research-center                        completed",NA,NA

"2198","A room-temperature all-solid-state 4.7 THz multiplied LO source to enable the heterodyne observation of interstellar neutral oxygen","Star formation is governed by gravity and heat. Triggered by a series of events, gravity's pull overcomes the random gas motions within a dense interstellar cloud, initiating a contraction phase that will last approximately 100,000 years and culminate in the formation of a star. During this collapse, the gas density increases. Collisions between atoms and molecules become more frequent and the gas temperature rises. Because the extent of the collapse is immense the resulting gas temperature increases from about 15 degrees Kelvin to over 11 million degrees Kelvin. Since a heated gas wants to expand, the cloud collapse could be halted or even reversed unless heat is effectively and continuously removed from the cloud. This cooling is mostly provided by emission of light of a variety of atoms and molecules, such as carbon, atom and molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydroxyl and water. The tracers of most of these processes, which lie mostly in the submillimeter and infrared spectrum, had been observed with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), NASA's Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO), and are now accessible at unprecedented high spectral (R=Î»/Î”Î»>1E6) and spatial resolution with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) on-board the Herschel Space Observatory.A long standing problem for our understanding of the quiescent dense interstellar medium (ISM), often described as molecular clouds, is the difficulty of accounting for the gas-phase abundance of carbon and oxygen. Atomic oxygen OI (observable at 63 Âµm) together with CII (158 Âµm) are the major coolants of photo-dissociation regions (PDR) in giant molecular clouds, with OI emission usually dominant at densities typical of dense molecular clouds (n>1E4 cm-3). However, while CII and other coolants can be observed with high-resolution with Herschel/HIFI, the atomic oxygen has never been observed with resolutions better than ~ 7 km/s. Without high-resolution observations of the OI fine line in both emission and absorption, the models that 'predict' the chemistry of ISM cannot be verified, revised and/or completed. Until this problem is solved, or in other words, until the fine OI atomic line is observed in high spectral and spatial resolution, the chemistry of oxygen in interstellar clouds and protostellar regions, essential for understanding the formation of stars and the incorporation of key molecules into forming planetary system, will not be fully understood.As a response to this problem, we will develop the first all-solid-state continuous coherent local oscillator (LO) source at 4.7 THz to enable very high-resolution heterodyne observation (R=Î»/Î”Î» > 1E6) of the 4.748 THz (63.1837 Âµm) fine structure line of neutral atomic oxygen (OI). This source will be broadband, frequency-agile, temperature and frequency stable and will operate at room-temperature (no need of cryogenic cooling). With hot electron bolometer detectors (HEB) already available, the proposed source is the only technological part that is still missing to provide the radio-astronomers with this highly necessary science data for the complete understanding of star and planetary systems formation processes.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active",NA,NA

"2200","Protecting cardiomyocytes from mixed fields of radiation by BIO 300, Phase I","The cumulative dose of radiation exposure to our astronauts remains one of the limiting roadblocks to longer duration missions in space.  Humanetics Corporation (Humanetics) is developing a novel radioprotectant, BIO 300, for use in both clinical radiotherapy and as a radiation countermeasure. BIO 300 is a safe, shelf-stable pharmaceutical which has been shown to mitigate both the acute and delayed effects of radiation exposure. BIO 300 is in advanced stages of clinical development, and is currently being evaluated as a radioprotectant of healthy lung tissue during radiotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer in a Phase I/II trial.  One component of developing radioprotectants for space is understanding if the therapy can protect against broad-spectrums of ionizing radiation, rather than just man-made X-Rays.  Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine BIO 300's radioprotective capabilities against mission-relevant doses of neutron/gamma mixed-fields of radiation.

We propose to develop an innovative air blower that can meet the challenging requirements for circulating ventilation air in an EVA suit using a reliable system that consumes little power.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by producing a conceptual design for the blower and building and demonstrating a proof-of-concept blower.

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates.

"2209","Low-Loss Ferrite Components for NASA Missions, Phase I","Ferrite based isolators and circulators have been successfully demonstrated at microwave, millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave frequencies. These components are nonreciprocal and thus highly useful for controlling standing waves and directing signal flow in frequency multiplier cascades, heterodyne, radar, radiometer, and other systems commonly deployed by NASA. However, at the higher frequencies the performance is degraded in terms of bandwidth and loss which severely limits their usefulness.Although there is a demonstrable need for these components, there are relatively few vendors. Most of the commercially available components were developed more than forty years ago and there has been little effort at modernization. Recent advances reported in the literature suggest that the loss in Faraday rotation isolators can be significantly reduced. Using modern electromagnetic simulation tools, we propose to design millimeter-wave and sub-millimeter-wave ferrite components that exhibit significantly reduced loss, and improved power handling and bandwidth.Initial work on the development of a W-band isolator is underway. Ferrite cores have been manufactured and the impedance matching structures have been designed. We plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach within the six month timeframe of the SBIR Phase I program. We have also successfully modeled Y-junction circulators that accurately predict performance similar to those available in the commercial market and are now working on several approaches to increase the bandwidth of these devices. A preliminary design operating at 160 GHz has been completed. In the Phase I program, the design will be refined, built and tested. Beyond Phase I, our goal is to develop a full line of ferrite components operating from 75 GHz to over 320 GHz with significantly improved performance over the current state-of-the-art.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        jet-propulsion-labo...",NA,NA

"2217","VG2 NEP PLS DERIVED RDR ION INBOUND S-WIND 48SEC V1.0","This data set gives the best available values for ion densities, temperatures, and velocities near Neptune derived from data obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment. All parameters are obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function of energy) with Maxwellian plasma distributions, using a non-linear least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which, when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the data. The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the plasma is co-moving). In the upstream solar wind protons are fit to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain accurate plasma parameters. In the magnetosheath the ion flux so low that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be reliably fit. These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton maxwellians with the same velocity. The values given in the upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the density-weighted temperature. In both the upstream solar wind and magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures are derived for each fit component. In the magnetosphere spectra do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity vectors, so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal. In some cases the azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid corotation is assumed. In the 'outer' magnetosphere (L>5) two distinct current peaks appear in the spectra H+ and N+. In the inner magnetosphere the plasma is hot and the composition is ambiguous, although two superimposed Maxwellians are still required to fit the data. These spectra are fit using two compositions, one with H+ and N+ and the second with two H+ components. The N+ composition is preferred by the data provider. All fit values in the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It should be noted that no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10 V in this region and will effect the density and velocity values. In the outbound magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given for velocity, density, and thermal speed. The signal-to-noise ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause, which can Result in the analysis giving incorrect values. The L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate determinations parameters in many regions temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","comet-sl9-jupiter-c...                        neptune                        voyager","Earth Science",NA
"2218","Photonic IC Spectrometer for Spacecraft, Phase I","CubeSat/SmallSat bus infrastructure imposes stringent mass, power, footprint, and volume constraints on science instruments such as spectrometers.  Nanohmics, Inc., proposes teaming with researchers at the Catholic University of America (CUA) to develop a real-time spectrometer that demonstrates photonic integrated circuit (IC) interferometric capabilities for the first time in the MWIR spectral band, and achieves extremely low size, weight and power (SWaP).  The Nanohmics/CUA team proposes in Phase I to design and fabricate a proof of concept (PoC) photonic IC spectrometer operating in the MWIR, with TRL 3.  Laboratory testing of the Phase I photonic IC device will strengthen the scaled-up photonic IC spectrometer prototype design for Phase II. The CUA research partner will perform finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling and simulation.  In Phase II, the team will fabricate and test the scaled-up photonic IC spectrometer prototype, achieving TRL 6.  The photonic IC spectrometer uses an array of interferometers that are microfabricated on the IC to output a real-time spatial interference pattern that is similar to the spectrograph obtained via time-scanning in Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) such as Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR). However, the photonic IC spectrograph is instantaneous and obtained by an instrument with no moving parts, similar to a class of devices called a spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS).  A stack of photonic IC spectrometers acts as a one-dimensional (1D) imaging array and performs hyperspectral imaging for remote sensing and other applications.  Wavelengths in the MWIR range (~3-5 micrometers) will allow the use of common microfabrication techniques and materials, which will keep costs low.  Our expertise in developing planar waveguide structures places Nanohmics in a unique position for fabricating photonic IC spectrometers.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA
"2219","MEMS Skin Friction Sensor, Phase I","Interdisciplinary Consulting Corporation proposes a sensor that offers the unique capability to make non-intrusive, direct, simultaneous mean and fluctuating shear stress measurement for subsonic and transonic test applications. Currently a standard for shear stress measurement tool does not exist.A precise silicon micromachined, differential capacitive, instrumentation grade sensor will facilitate skin friction measurement with high bandwidth, high resolution, and minimal sensitivity to pressure. The proposed sensor possesses through wafer vias for backside electrical contacts to enable non-intrusive measurements in turbulent boundary layers. A robust and compact package with miniature interface electronics enables flush sensor mounting conformal with surfaces.  The sensor development effort transitions a proof-of-concept device by adding design components to have reduced pressure sensitivity to result in a commercially viable product. Circuit topology development for biasing and signal conditioning provides the ability to make simultaneous mean and dynamic shear stress measurement. The sensor performance will exceed its predecessors and set the standard for quantitative skin friction measurements. The simplicity of sensor design and an equally simple and proven fabrication technique allows for low cost, high performance sensors.The sensor holds promise to transform current flow control techniques and enable efficient aerodynamic designs. Existing shear stress estimation techniques rely on known correlation to a measured quantity. Direct measurement eliminates the need for a known correlation in an unknown flow. Capacitive transduction has been successful for a highly sensitive device with a large dynamic range and low noise floor, which is the current state of the art. The proposed sensor may therefore be improved beyond the state of the art to serve as a measurement standard for all types of skin friction measurement techniques.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        langley-research-ce...",NA,NA

Elec- trolytic capacitors are used in several applications ranging from power supplies on critical avionics equipment to power drivers for electro-mechanical actuators. These devices are known for their comparatively low reliability and given their criticality in electronics subsystems they are good candi- dates for component level prognostics and health manage- ment.

"2223","A High Efficiency Cryocooler for In-Space Cryogenic Propellant Storage, Phase I","NASA is considering multiple missions involving long-term cryogen storage in space.  Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the typical cryogens as they provide the highest specific impulse of practical chemical propellants.  These cryogens are stored at temperatures of nominally 20 K for hydrogen and 90 K for oxygen.  Due to the large size of these tanks, refrigeration loads to maintain zero-boil-off are high, on the order of 10's of watts at 20 K and 100's of watts at 90 K.  Space cryocoolers have been developed for cooling space sensors that have modest cooling loads and are not suitable for high capacity applications.  On this program, we propose to develop a high capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler that provides 150 W of refrigeration at 90 K.  On the Phase I project, we will design the cryocooler, assessing the size, mass, and performance, and assess development risks.

"2224","Polymer Derived Ceramic Based Structural Thermal Protection Systems for Atmospheric Entry Vehicles, Phase I","The development of robust and efficient Entry, Descent and Landing systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to planetary surfaces through challenging environments. Future NASA missions will require new technologies to further space exploration and delivery of high mass loads. Of particular interest is the development of reusable hot structure technologies for primary structures exposed to extreme heating environments on atmospheric entry vehicles. A hot structure system is a multifunctional structure that can reduce/eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system. Thus, there is a need for the development of new technologies to support the realization of low-cost, durable/reusable hot structures applicable to atmospheric entry vehicles.  A key barrier is the requirement for the lightweight form to not only carry mechanical loads but also accommodate high temperatures (1000-2200°C), severe transient heating, and temperature gradients through the thickness.  Novel materials and associated fabrication processes are needed to balance the demand for structural cohesiveness with desired thermal properties required to protect structure interiors.  Sporian Microsystems has developed advanced ceramic materials for harsh environments with a particular focus on materials technologies based on ultra-high temperature polymer derived silicon carbonitride (SiCN).  The long-term objective of this proposed work is to heavily leverage prior preceramic precursor based insulating materials development, and revise processes that can be used to realize hot structure systems.  The PhI effort will focus on assessing candidate processes and SiCN precursor formulation to create relevant load-bearing, insulating structures, then demonstrating technical feasibility by producing and testing hot structure samples. If successful, Sporian will be well prepared for Phase II efforts focused on producing demo units for NASA testing and addressing vehicle integration.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        armstrong-flight-re...",NA,NA
"2225","Incremental Evolution of a 10/250 NLV into a 20/450 NMSLV, Phase I","The technical innovation proposed here is the continued functional evolution and concept refinement of an incremental series of test vehicles that will ultimately provide dedicated, low-cost, reliable, on-demand routine space access for the emerging nano and micro satellite markets.  Initial orbital operational capability for delivering 10 kg to a 250 km circular LEO is achieved with a two-stage, pressure-fed ""10/250"" Nanosat Launch Vehicle (NLV) that will pathfind performance, production, regulatory and operational challenges.  This NLV will then be followed by a clustered ""20/450"" Nano/Micro Satellite Launch Vehicle (NMSLV) that addresses this topic's primary objective of providing a capability to place nano and micro satellites weighing up to 20 kg into 450 km circular LEO.Aggressive leveraging of our team's existing NLV development initiative enables significant hardware development and the start of static fire testing during Phase I, followed by actual flight testing in Phase II for TRL-7 technology evaluations.  These tests have incrementally introduced state of the art capabilities like advanced propellants (LOX/propylene) and structures (composite cryogenic tanks).  The Phase I effort focuses on the development of the next class of test vehicle  a high altitude suborbital single booster stage (the ""P-K"") that features closed-loop thrust vector control (TVC) and candidate avionics technologies for guidance and navigation, as well as eventual autonomous flight termination systems (AFTS) for range safety, TRDRSS-based telemetry and tracking functions.  In addition, it will incorporate features needed to implement the clustered first stage configuration and second stage separation method associated with the 20/450 NMSLV. The Phase II effort will then focus on the further development of an NMSLV-type first stage with two additional  core boosters, for a total of three, and the conducting of a high-altitude demonstration flight.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        kennedy-space-center",NA,NA
"2226","High Performance Sealed Tube Cross Strip Photon Counting Sensors for UV-Vis Astrophysics Instruments","The objective of this program is to exploit the developments in atomic layer deposited (ALD) microchannel plates (MCPs), photocathodes and cross strip (XS) readout techniques to provide a new generation of enhanced performance sealed tube photon counting sensors that span the 115nm to 400nm regime. Efforts in all the subcomponent areas have achieved considerable technical development and heritage, but putting them into a robust integrated package with advanced TRL for the next UV-Vis Astrophysics instruments has not been done to date. Component developments include ALD MCP formats up to 127 x 127 mm with 10 µm pores, background rates of ~0.05 events/cm2/sec, and extended lifetimes to >10 C/cm2. XS anodes and electronics have shown spatial resolutions of <18µm FWHM over formats of 100 x 100mm and event handling rates of 5 MHz at 10 cm) formats in the UV to Visible regimes. The smaller pore sizes (~10 µm) and high resolution XS readouts will facilitate higher spatial resolutions over the large formats. At the same time the reduced (÷3) detection efficiency for high-energy background events demonstrated by use of ALD MCPs will also improve observational sensitivities. The chemical compatibility of the new MCP borosilicate glass and the ALD materials has the potential to provide further improvements in the stability and lifetime of these detectors due to the rigorous pre-conditioning steps for sealed tubes. In addition, improvements in fabrication processes provide the opportunity to reduce the imaging fixed pattern modulation and thermal resistance changes. XS readouts integrated into sealed tube packages can also fully take advantage of the efforts currently taking place to establish high performance, spaceflight compatible, low power-mass-volume ASIC readout electronics. These developments will together provide a significant step in the realization of high performance, robust, MCP detectors for the next generations of UV Astrophysics instruments.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","active                        regents-of-the-univ...",NA,NA

"2228","Characterization and Modeling of Fundamental Parameters of a Membrane-Aerated Biological Reactor","Inherent in the expansion of human presence in space is the development of life support systems that are capable of meeting the demands of extended space habitation. Within these systems, water is the most critical life support element, representing, at minimum, 65% of the daily mass input for crew members. A reliable water source is therefore a critical item for long term space habitation, whether in orbit (e.g. ISS), on the moon, Mars or beyond. Water recycling systems allow the regeneration of potable water from waste streams, thus eliminating mission dependence on initial water reserves or resupply scenarios. However, current water recovery systems that employ only physical and chemical processes are intensive users of resources and ultimately result in trading the cost of stored water for the costs of power consumption and consumables. Membrane aerated biological reactors (MABRs) provide an attractive sustainable alternative due to the ability to maximize effluent quality, and recycle valuable components (e.g. H2O, N2).  MABRs harness the benefits of biological treatment (transformation of organic matter and NH3 to CO2, NOx- and N2 gas, production of a more stable end waste product , and favorable pHs for further physio-chemical treatment) while also minimizing the impact on the habitation environment and decreasing the demand for inputs such as O2 by increasing removal efficiency. Much of the current research on MABRs provides results that are specific to the reactor configuration or the particular waste-stream loading. Current design and operation is at best semi-empirical as a number of interrelated fundamental processes including biological, physical, and chemical processes are not currently described sufficiently to allow the development of quantitative robust models.  The proposed work will provide essential characterization of MABR systems and develop a quantitative understanding of the interdependence of gas flow, loading rate, biofilm microbial ecology, and membrane density in order to optimize the design and operation of MABRs. The successful completion of this objective would be the development of guiding principles based on the waste stream composition and desired treatment levels.  Experimental data will be collected from a bench-scale reactors designed and operated at Texas Tech University.  Additionally, data will be collected from the Counter-diffusion Membrane Aerated Nitrifying Denitrifying Reactor (CoMANDR) developed at Texas Tech University and scheduled for implementation as part of an integrated system test conducted at Johnson Space Center.  The experimental data will be used to develop and validate theoretical models that can be used as predictive tools for operation and design of further MABR systems. The benefits of this research will not only apply to space based water reuse, but will also have numerous terrestrial applications thus continuing the legacy of space based technologies providing significant benefits to broader applications.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        texas-tech-university",NA,NA

In addition to improved TPS performance, NASA would benefit from a TPS integrated with the sub-structure thereby improving thermal efficiency, insulation performance, system thermal-structural performance, and system integrity with the goal of achieving increased system reliability, reduced areal mass, and/or decreased costs over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA).FMI proposes developing its multi-layered, graded, hybrid ICS system for application to NASA missions.

"2235","NextGen Optical Clock","The overall goal of this project is to establish optical lattice clock capability at JPL and to develop a critical path to a flight clock instrument for upcoming fundamental physics opportunities by developing and demonstrating a lattice optical clock prototype, performing at the 10^-16 level precision or better. It was recognized in the 2011 NRC Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space that the potential of these clocks for fundamental science, in particular, has reached a critical level for unprecedented measurements of the gravitational redshift, variations of fundamental constants, Lorentz violations, gravitational wave detection, and relativistic geodesy to name a few. Building on the state-of-the-art laboratory lattice clock design at JILA/NIST, which demonstrated record stability and accuracy (at the 10^-18 level) during the PI’s tenure as a NIST/NRC postdoc on that project, and the expertise and capability at JPL for developing space-qualified atomic sensors/facilities for fundamental physics (e.g., the Cold Atom Laboratory), we anticipate to quickly take the lead in developing space-qualified optical clocks. Optical atomic clocks are widely accepted as a revolutionary advancement in the evolution of atomic frequency standards. The maturity of these clocks, which operate at optical frequencies for higher quality-factor as compared to their microwave counterparts, has rapidly progressed to the point where numerous lab-based systems now outperform the best cesium clocks by orders of magnitude in both accuracy and stability. For comparison, an optical clock (OC) designed at JPL, with performance at the level of 10^-18 in fractional frequency units, will outperform the highest-precision cesium clock in space (ACES scheduled for launch to the ISS in 2017) by nominally two orders of magnitude with similar size and weight requirements. The target performance of the OC is extrapolated from that demonstrated in laboratory lattice clocks at JILA/NIST.    The key to utilizing the exceptional performance demonstrated by the optical lattice clocks in space now requires engineering development to extend from the laboratory designs to space-qualified instrument that can fit with the space and power constraints of e.g. the ISS. With the exception of ESA Space Optical Clock, there has been virtually no effort in developing optical clocks for space applications. Based on the expertise and capabilities at JPL for developing space-qualified atomic sensors/facilities for fundamental physics (e.g., the Cold Atom Lab), we anticipate to quickly take the lead developing space-qualified optical clocks during the R&TD project.        Five key components will be developed in this task: 1) Cooling and trapping the atoms in dual-stage (“Blue” and “Red”) MOTs to achieve high density in the “ultracold” regime. 2) An optical lattice to confine the atoms and remove broadening and shifts associated with the photon recoil, Doppler, and AC Stark effects. 3) The ultra-stable clock laser, with line width at or below the Hz level. 4) State-detection and feedback to stabilize the clock-laser, and 5) Time transfer of the clock signal to the microwave domain using an optical frequency comb.    Many of the critical parts for the first and second components are commercially available and relatively technically mature, including the diode lasers and ultra-high vacuum hardware at the heart of the high-flux atom source. We will innovate in developing the laser systems, electromagnets, control electronics, and the physics package in a compact and rugged design. Components 3 and 4 will require significant innovation to develop compact and low-power breadboard subsystems designed to reduce the risk of extending the high-stability and performance of their lab-based counterparts for future flight designs.

Currently, thermophotovoltaics suffer from low efficiencies, where only a small fraction of the total thermal energy is converted to electrical energy. One key to improving efficiency is to match the emitter spectrum more precisely to the conversion characteristics, using engineered metamaterial emitters. Metamaterials have shown great promise as efficient narrow-band selective emitters that can provide the improved spectral match between emitter and converter. To address the opportunity afforded by a novel metamaterials-based TPV emitter film, Nanohmics Inc. and Dr. Gennady Shvets at The University of Texas at Austin propose to develop the TAloNTM Emitter, a high-temperature,  ultra-thin thermal emitter of infrared radiation for TPVs. Despite its simplicity and amenability to straightforward fabrication, our design encompasses all the advantages mentioned above: extremely highly selective emission, tunability of emission frequency, sub-wavelength size, and large field enhancement inside the metamaterial.

Most free-piston Stirling (FPS) convertors are piston-displacer machines that use complex gas bearing/ flexure strategies to manage the wear of reciprocating and close-fitting internal components.  The reliability of these mechanisms is critical to overall system performance and longevity.  Converter Source, LLC has developed a double-acting free-piston Stirling arrangement that eliminates displacers and the problem of displacer seal wear while at the same time reducing the number of distinct parts required for the machine.The key design features of the new convertor most relevant to the space power application include: integrated alternator functionality within the piston assembly, eliminating connecting structures and buffer volumes with associated pressure walls, thereby reducing system mass compared to conventional technology, compatibility with simple lightweight hydrodynamic gas bearings to eliminate piston seal wear, dynamically-balanced radial layout that surrounds the heat source at the center, and heat rejection to ambient at the outer perimeter.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        glenn-research-center",NA,NA

We will use the RAP process (a plasma-based non-contact shaping tool) along with conventional steps to shape a series of lightweight optics, culminating in a 12"" asphere.  We will finish these optics to final specification using one of several candidate sub-aperture finishing tools.  The avoidance of surface and subsurface damage by the use of this non-contact RAP process is expected to substantially reduce the time and cost of optical finishing of lightweight SiC optics.  We will also demonstrate the scalability of the RAP process for SiC optics and optical segments up to 2 meters.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        marshall-space-flig...",NA,NA

"2264","Wavelength Drift Corrector for Wind Lidar Receivers, Phase II","We propose to develop and demonstrate an receiver system utilizing our novel technique for tracking and compensating for laser wavelength shifts in lidar systems.  During Phase 1, we demonstrated that in addition to tracking and correcting for laser frequency drift, the system is able to track and correct for etalon frequency drift (in fact, only this relative frequency drift can be tracked).  Data was collected before, during and after a frequency drift over a period of time typical of lidar data integration times.  It was seen that integrating without the correction resulted in data too blurred to have any value, but that the correction system compensated for the shift and allowed for proper wavelength measurements.  We now look to incorporate this technique into a lidar receiver system and demonstrate its viability in measuring wind velocity.  This receiver would prove the ability to reduce the cost and technical difficulties in building a wind lidar system both for NASA programs (NASA-GSFC CATS wind lidar) and commercial systems for use in weather forecasting and airport wind shear monitoring.","November 12, 2020","November 12, 2020","Space Technology Mission Directorate","completed                        goddard-space-fligh...",NA,NA

The MLS can also indicate the presence of contaminants such as nitrogen used to purge the system. The current methods use either wire resistance measurements, capacitance or point sensors, combined with pressure and temperature measurements.  The MLS will be lighter, require less energy to operate, and provide less heat leak than existing technologies. Current techniques will not function correctly in boiling or stratified liquid cryogens or in reduced gravity. During phase I, Proof-of Concept experiments will be performed with liquid methane.
