"1","Replication Data for: The Politics of Interruptions: Gendered Disruptions of Legislative Speeches","Floor time in legislatures is a valuable commodity that legislators use to gain political capital and electoral benefits. There are well-known political and institutional barriers to participation, but these do not explain gender differences in access to floor time. In this paper, we look at the role interruptions play as potential barriers to floor time. We explore how women strategically react to these barriers, and consider how these reactions ultimately lead to gendered differences in legislative participation. Our findings show that differences in participation across genders are a consequence of rational strategies followed by women who sacrifice floor time in the short term to avoid the long-term consequences of challenging gendered barriers, such as interruptions. We test our argument using original data on legislative speeches from the Ecuadorian Congress between 1988 and 2018.","Social Sciences","Gender, Legislative Speeches, Interruptions","2021-07-20","Vallejo Vera, Sebastian (Tecnológico de Monterrey) - ORCID: 0000-0002-5848-7400                                                    Gómez Vidal, Analía (Inter-American Development Bank)","Vallejo Vera, Sebastian","Vallejo Vera, Sebastian; Gómez Vidal, Analía, 2021, ""Replication Data for: The Politics of Interruptions: Gendered Disruptions of Legislative Speeches"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6IRAEM, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"

"11","Replication Data for: The negative consequences of sports gambling opportunities on human capital formation: evidence from Spain","This repository contains the replication package--the instructions, data and code-- necessary to replicate the results presented in Espadafor & Martínez (2021). The proliferation of on-site betting shops has received enormous public attention, becoming one of the most alarming health policy issues in contemporary cities. However, there is little evidence on whether its growing presence nearby vulnerable populations produce social harm beyond its known adverse individual effects. This study provides new evidence on the negative societal effects of betting houses. Our research design takes advantage of a new wave of openings in Madrid (Spain), which created a sudden increase in the supply of on-site gambling. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that new betting houses decline nearby high schools' educational performance, especially in public schools in less advantaged areas. This effect is neither trivial nor diminishing with time. This evidence suggests that betting houses increase inequality of educational opportunities. The ubiquity of betting houses around vulnerable populations in multiple regions drives us to think that these findings have relevant policy implications for many countries currently designing policies tackling the increase of problem gambling.

WX21 was fielded June 9 – July 17, 2021 using an online questionnaire that was completed by 1,550 US adults (age 18+) that were recruited from an Internet panel that matches the characteristics of the U.S. population as estimated in the U.S. Census. WX17 and WX18 were designed to establish baseline measures of the extent to which US adults receive, understand, and respond to severe weather forecasts and warnings; WX19 and WX20 were designed to continue and, in some cases, refine the measurement of these concepts. WX21 continues to measure these core concepts, giving us 5 years of consistent data to continue measuring change. Additionally, WX21 measured public trust in the National Weather Service (NWS), extreme weather and climate risk perceptions, risk literacy, interpretations of probabilistic language, and interpretation of longer-range severe weather forecasts (like those from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center).","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-08","Ripberger, Joseph (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Krocak, Makenzie (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Silva, Carol (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Jenkins-Smith, Hank (University of Oklahoma)","Krocak, Makenzie","Ripberger, Joseph; Krocak, Makenzie; Silva, Carol; Jenkins-Smith, Hank, 2021, ""WX21"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QYZLSO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:Z2TF/SuLbAgTzrdUBe1+rw== [fileUNF]","c(""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"")","c(1, 0, 0, NA)","c(212, NA, NA, NA)","c(1550, NA, NA, NA)"

We respond in two ways. First, we point out that principles of good science dictate that we discard dispute cases that either cannot be substantiated by the historical record or that do not meet dataset coding rules; we also discuss the ten-thousand-plus changed values PDKM still have not examined. Second, contrary to PDKM, we demonstrate how data differences greatly affect previous studies by returning again to the replications. There were substantial errors in both of PDKM’s replications, and these errors led them to incorrect inferences.

"21","Replication Data for: Updating the Militarized Interstate Dispute Data: A Response to Gibler, Miller, and Little","In a recent article, Gibler, Miller, and Little (2016) (GML) conduct an extensive review of the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data between the years 1816 and 2001, highlighting possible inaccuracies and recommending a substantial number of changes to the data. They contend that, in several instances, analyses with their revised data lead to substantively different inferences. Here, we review GML's MID drop and merge recommendations and reevaluate the substantive impact of their changes. We are in agreement with about 76 percent of the recommended drops and merges. However, we find that some of the purported overturned findings in GML's replications are not due to their data, but rather to the strategies they employ for replication. We reexamine these findings and conclude that the remaining differences in inference stemming from the variations in the MID data are rare and modest in scope.

"22","The Effect of Core Values on Support for Electoral Reform: Evidence from Two Survey Experiments","A central tenet in the electoral systems subfield is that parties seek desired outcomes via the strategic adoption of electoral rules. Such partisan self-interest, however, is merely one explanation for reform: a second is that an actor may attempt to maximize her core values, which constitute her perception of the ‘common good.’ Although the extant literature has demonstrated the motivational power of core values, their effect on electoral rule choice has not been tested. Using a factorial experimental design that manipulates the partisan- and values-implications of a fictitious reform proposal, I find evidence in favor of core values: not only do they have an effect net of partisan concerns, but they also attenuate the effect of partisan self-interest when the two predispositions countervail. The results provide evidence that partisan self-interest offers an incomplete picture: actors hold—and pursue through electoral reform—objectives that are not immediately partisan in nature.

The intervention facilitated critical discussion about nutrition and media, mentored by the parent. Results showed that youths’ increases in fruit and vegetable consumption flowed from parent-child discussion of nutrition labels, which was predicted by child-initiated discussion, critical thinking about media sources, and critical thinking about media content. Multivariate analyses revealed that the intervention was productive for all participating age groups and for all dependent variables. The results suggest that a developmental progression from critical thinking about source to critical thinking about content affects behavior change and can be catalyzed through media literacy education and encouragement to discuss media messages (i.e. practice) with parents.

"61","Auditory feedback on proprioception increases bodily awareness","Multiple studies have shown the importance of movement and physical exercise like dance for human wellbeing and mental health. Yet, factors influencing proprioception and body awareness in the context of exercise remain largely unexplored. This is mostly due to the lack of tools and techniques to record, manipulate and intervene on body awareness during real-time movements. To this end, we designed FUGA, a wearable device delivering continuous real-time auditory feedback on human gestures. Here we tested whether we could manipulate bodily awareness during physical exercise and dance using auditory feedback on proprioception. Following a within-subject design, we tested the effects of the device using different sounds in three populations of dancers: novice, amateurs and professionals. We found that across populations the wearable had a significant effect on the participant’s rating of feelings of bodily awareness, ​reward, immersion, embodiment, and self-efficacy. We discuss these results in the light of recent theories of predictive coding and active inference, emphasizing the role of action, proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback in human behavior. Building upon these results, we suggest future studies to explore the potential of auditory proprioceptive feedback for mental health.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",NA,"2021-07-19","Schoeller, Félix (MIT)","Schoeller, Félix","Schoeller, Félix, 2021, ""Auditory feedback on proprioception increases bodily awareness"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/T85DBO, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""Fuga V7.xlsx"", ""Fuga V7.xlsx"")","c(1, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)"

"63","Data for CAIT-UTC-REG2B - Sustainable, Rapid Repair Utilizing Advanced Cementitious Materials","Durability and resilience of a structure are typically considered separately, as they address structural performance under different types of loads. A systematic framework for combined durability-resilience assessment of an RC bridge column is presented in this article. Corrosion of steel reinforcement is the main deterioration mechanism considered for durability evaluation, and earthquakes are assumed to be the primary hazard for resilience assessment. An example bridge column with two types of cover materials – conventional concrete and ductile fiber-reinforced concrete – is considered in our study. The ductile fiber-reinforced concrete provides better durability than the conventional concrete, resulting in lower rebar mass loss at a given time. Fick’s second law of diffusion is used to model the corrosion initiation phase. A pitting corrosion model, accounting for the effects of cracking on the corrosion rate, is considered for the corrosion propagation phase. Seismic fragility curves are constructed by nonlinear dynamic analysis, incorporating the rebar mass loss, at discrete times during the life span of the bridge. The results indicate that corrosion of reinforcement increases the vulnerability of the bridge column to seismic hazard.

"66","Replication Data for: Gender, Candidate Emotional Expression, and Voter Reactions During Televised Debates","Replication data for: Gender, Candidate Emotional Expression, and Voter Reactions During Televised Debates Voters evaluate politicians not just by what they say, but also how they say it, via facial displays of emotions and vocal pitch. Candidate characteristics can shape how leaders use---and how voters react to---nonverbal cues. Drawing on role congruity expectations, we study how the use of and reactions to facial, vocal, and textual communication in political debates varies by candidate gender. Relying on full-length videos of four German federal election debates (2005--2017) and a minor party debate, we use video, audio, and text data to measure candidate facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger than her male opponents, but is just as emotive in other respects. Combining these measures of emotional expression with continuous responses recorded by live audiences, we find that voters punish Merkel for anger displays and reward her happiness and general emotional displays.

We trace the relationship between shifting macro-political conditions and individual-level political values in the Middle East, demonstrating that a preference for democracy and political trust are not fixed cultural features of populations but rather can shift rapidly in the face of perceived insecurity. Our empirical analyses employ longitudinal data from the Arab Barometer covering 13 countries and data from the 2015 World Values Survey, which includes both Arab and non-Arab countries in order to benchmark regional developments against global patterns. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on the political effects of insecurity and oppose culturalist depictions of fixed political attitudes among Muslims in narrow perspectives on the relationship between Islam and democracy.","Social Sciences","Political values, Democracy, Political trust, Arab countries, Middle East","2021-07-19","Cammett, Melani (Harvard University) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8745-4608                                                    Diwan (Ishac)                                                    Vartanova (Irina)","Cammett, Melani","Cammett, Melani; Diwan; Vartanova, 2021, ""Insecurity and Political Values in the Arab World"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PJF1JB, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:/WO20cP1BxeN/altyy67cA== [fileUNF]","c(""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(22, 8, NA, NA, NA)","c(43493, 59, NA, NA, NA)"

This is a sub sample of KMOS redshift one spectroscopic survey (KROSS) previously studied by \citet{GS20}. The stellar masses (M∗) of these objects were previously estimated using mass-to-light ratios derived from fitting the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies. Star formation rates were derived from the Hα luminosities. The total gas masses (Mgas) are determined by scaling relations of molecular and atomic gas \citep[][respectively] {Tacconi2018, Lagos2011}. The dynamical masses (Mdyn) are directly derived from the rotation curves (RCs) at different scale lengths (effective radius: Re, ∼2 Re and ∼3 Re) and then the dark matter fractions (fDM=1−Mbar/Mdyn) at these radii are calculated. We report that at z∼1 only a small fraction (∼5%) of our sample has a low (<20%) DM fraction within ∼ 2-3 Re. The majority (>72%) of SFGs in our sample have dark matter dominated outer disks (∼5−10 kpc) in agreement with local SFGs. Moreover, we find a large scatter in the fraction of dark matter at a given stellar mass (or circular velocity) with respect to local SFGs, suggesting that galaxies at z∼1, a) span a wide range of stages in the formation of stellar disks, b) have diverse DM halo properties coupled with baryons (2021-07-17)","Physics","Astrophysics","2021-07-17","Sharma, Gauri (Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati) - ORCID: 0000-0002-6070-2851","Sharma, Gauri","Sharma, Gauri, 2021, ""Dark matter fraction in z ~1 star-forming galaxies"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/O1KKIV, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""GS21b_catalog.fits"", ""GS21b_catalog.fits"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)"
"97","Replication Data for: State As Salesman: International  Economic Engagement and Foreign News Coverage in China","How does an authoritarian regime cover news about foreign countries for its domestic audience? What accounts for the variation in news coverage received by different foreign countries? While existing literature points to political concerns at home, in this article, we argue that a regime's economic interests can also be a driving force: the desire to deepen its international economic engagement can motivate the regime to treat foreign countries differently in its news coverage. To test this argument, we examine foreign news coverage by China's state-run television network between 2003 and 2018. Combining textual and quantitative analysis, we find that countries with stronger economic ties with China receive more favorable news coverage. Moreover, the manipulation of coverage favorability is achieved through selective reporting: negative events such as armed conflicts receive less coverage when taking place in a country with close economic ties with China. These findings contribute to our understanding of international news flow, especially in a non-Western setting. They also demonstrate a pragmatic rather than political use of information control by an authoritarian government.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-17","Liu, Hanzhang (Pitzer College) - ORCID: 0000-0003-1003-1372                                                    Chengyuan Ji (Shanghai Jiaotong University)","Liu, Hanzhang","Liu, Hanzhang; Chengyuan Ji, 2021, ""Replication Data for: State As Salesman: International Economic Engagement and Foreign News Coverage in China"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JNI6TO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:IrjAUCOaIcmFTmgI1ArimQ== [fileUNF]","c(""news_fav.tab"", ""news_fav.tab"", ""news_fav.tab"")","c(0, 0, NA)","c(66, NA, NA)","c(3022, NA, NA)"

"112","Replication Data for: The rise and fall of cryptocurrency coins and tokens (coin data)","Since Bitcoin’s introduction in 2009, interest in cryptocurrencies has soared. One manifestation of this interest has been the explosion of newly created coins and tokens. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of this burgeoning industry. We consider both cryptocurrency coins and tokens. The paper examines the dynamics of coin and token creation, competition and destruction in the cryptocurrency industry. In order to conduct the analysis, we develop a methodology to identify peaks in prices and trade volume, as well as when coins and tokens are abandoned and subsequently “resurrected”. We also study trading activity. Our data spans more than 4 years: there are 1082 coins and 725 tokens in the data. While there are some similarities between coins and tokens regarding dynamics, there are some striking differences as well. Overall, we find that 44% of publicly-traded coins are abandoned, at least temporarily. 71% of abandoned coins are later resurrected, leaving 18% of coins to fail permanently. Tokens experience abandonment less frequently, with only 7% abandonment and 5% permanent token abandonment at the end of the data. Using linear regressions, we find that market variables such as the bitcoin price are not associated with the rate of introducing new coins, though they are positively associated with issuing new tokens. We find that for both coins and tokens, market variables are positively associated with resurrection. We then examine the effect that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble in December 2017 had on the dynamics in the industry. Unlike the end of the 2013 bubble, some alternative cryptocurrencies continue to flourish after the bursting of this bubble.

"114","Replication Data for: An examination of the cryptocurrency pump-and-dump ecosystem","The recent introduction of thousands of cryptocurrencies in an unregulated environment has created many opportunities for unscrupulous traders to profit from price manipulation. We quantify the scope of one widespread tactic, the “pump and dump”, in which actors coordinate to bid up the price of coins before selling at a profit. We joined all relevant channels on two popular group-messaging platforms, Telegram and Discord, and identified thousands of different pumps targeting hundreds of coins. We find that pumps are modestly successful in driving short-term price rises, but that this effect has diminished over time. We also find that the most successful pumps are those that are most transparent about their intentions. Combined with evidence of concentration among a small number of channels, we conclude that regulators have an opportunity to effectively crack down on this illicit activity that threatens broader adoption of blockchain technologies.

We examine whether Public Service Announcements (PSAs) can encourage the use of facemasks. We designed two PSAs. One PSA describes the benefits of using facemasks. The second uses a novel messenger (a retired US general) to advocate for facemasks. We conducted two studies. First, we aired our PSAs on television and surveyed residents of the media market to determine if they saw the PSA and how they felt about wearing facemasks. Second, we conducted a randomized experiment on a diverse national sample. Both studies suggest that exposure to our PSAs increased support for masks and induced greater compliance with public health advice.

Using a sample of American adult social media users, we match data from individuals’ Internet browser histories with a survey measuring the accuracy of political beliefs. We find that visits to partisan websites are at times related to misperceptions consistent with the political bias of the site. However, we do not find strong evidence that untrustworthy websites consistently relate to false beliefs. There is also little evidence that visits to less partisan, centrist news sites are associated with more accurate political beliefs about these issues, suggesting that exposure to politically neutral news is not necessarily the antidote to misinformation. Results suggest that focusing on partisan news sites—rather than untrustworthy sites—may be fruitful to understanding how media contribute to political misperceptions.","Social Sciences","Behavioral data, misinformation","2021-03-22","Menchen-Trevino, Ericka (American University) - ORCID: 0000-0002-5029-8269                                                    Brian Weeks (University of Michigan) - ORCID: 0000-0003-2355-2302                                                    Christopher Calabrese (University of California Davis)                                                    Andreu Casas (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)                                                    Magdalena Wojcieszak (University of California Davis)","Menchen-Trevino, Ericka","Menchen-Trevino, Ericka; Brian Weeks; Christopher Calabrese; Andreu Casas; Magdalena Wojcieszak, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Partisan Media, Untrustworthy News Sites, and Political Misperceptions"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PGQUWF, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:hZeGG8FlWh04ULebck7etA== [fileUNF]","c(""replication_misperceptions_nms.sps"", ""replication_misperceptions_nms.sps"", ""replication_misperceptions_nms.sps"")","c(0, 1, NA)","c(20, NA, NA)","c(671, NA, NA)"
"122","Replication Data for: Which Narrative Strategies Durably Reduce Prejudice? Evidence From Field and Survey Experiments Supporting the Efficacy of Perspective-Getting","Exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups contribute to social and political challenges worldwide. Previous field experiments found that interpersonal conversations employing multiple narrative strategies can durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. We theoretically distinguish between three of these narrative strategies: narratives which promote analogic perspective-taking, vicarious perspective-giving, and perspective-getting. Previous research has assigned these strategies together in a compound treatment, leaving open important theoretical and practical questions about each's effectiveness. We present results from three field studies and a survey experiment that individually manipulate their presence. Across the field studies, we find omitting prompts to engage in analogic perspective-taking and vicarious perspective-giving does not diminish effects; conversations employing only perspective-getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. Results from within-subject analyses and a survey experiment similarly show that perspective-getting consistently reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple mechanisms. These results refine theoretical understandings of prejudice reduction and support facilitating perspective-getting in conversations intended to reduce exclusionary attitudes.","Social Sciences","Prejudice reduction, Field experiments, Political science","2021-04-14","Kalla, Joshua (Yale University) - ORCID: 0000-0003-3553-3862                                                    Broockman, David (University of California, Berkeley) - ORCID: 0000-0002-0993-7073","Kalla, Joshua","Kalla, Joshua; Broockman, David, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Which Narrative Strategies Durably Reduce Prejudice?

Each map was made from 13 consecutive sets of global map swaths taken during a time period of about a sol by the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft. This dataset contains the standard resolution (0.1 degree longitude by 0.1 degree latitude, covering 180W-180E, 90S-90N) color MDGMs for MARCI subphases from P01 to J08 (Mars Year 28-33, data collected during 2006-2016). The maps are organized into ""P"" (for P01-P22), ""B"" for (B01-B22), ""G"" (for G01-G23), ""D"" (for D01-D22), ""F"" (for F01-F23) and ""J"" (for J01-J08) folders. The folders are tarred and gzipped. Information for the Mars year and solar longitude (Ls) value of each MDGM can be found from a .txt file within each subphase folder. The list of images used to construct the MDGMs can be found in the list/ subdirectory of each subphase folder. The time range covered by each subphase can be found in the summary_subphases.txt file. The Notes associated with this dataset provides additional information. The MDGMs in TIFF format, maps for 7 individual MARCI camera filters, 0.05 degree by 0.05 degree visible and color maps, and more information can be found in the original archive bundle at NASA's PDS Annex Astropedia website when the data are appended: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/MarsReconnaissanceOrbiter/MARCI/MARS-MRO-MARCI-Mars-Daily-Global-Maps. For users' convenience, the documents (readme.pdf, processing.pdf and errata.pdf) for the PDS4 archive are replicated here. The MDGMs are intended for a quick look of time-variable phenomena on Mars from day to day. The color of MDGMs results from an arbitrary color scheme that is applied across all maps, but users can apply their own color stretch using image manipulating software.

The procedure used is described in Wang and Gonzalez Abad [2021]. The MDGMs used include slight modifications from those at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/U3766S and are included in this archive. The product is at 0.1° longitude × 0.1° latitude resolution and is available for each day from Mars Year 28 Ls = 132° to Mars Year 29 Ls = 135° (i.e., MARCI subphases from P01 to P22 and B01). The data are organized according to subphases with each tar file corresponding to one subphase. Each subphase contains about a month of data and includes a list_ls.txt file, a cloudmask/ subdirectory and a mdgms/ subdirectory. The list_ls.txt file lists the name, Mars year and solar longitude (Ls) value for each MDGM. The MDGMs are in JPEG format. The cloud masks are in NetCDF format, and contains variables named “longitude”, “latitude”, and “cloudmask”. In the cloud masks, -999 Indicates invalid value due to missing or excluded data, 0 indicates non-cloudy pixel and positive values indicate cloudy pixels.

They exist and thus every treating physician and surgeon happens to come across it. We try to put major contemporary practices and facts in a single bucket from learned skills of neurology and oncology tradition and things we received as feedback from our patients in clinical settings. Purpose of this work is to refresh your knowledge and preparedness for seeing patients with brain cancer. Brain tumors are molecularly heterogeneous and their features depend upon size, site, and genetic make-up of tumor, aggressive growth, and adjacent structures. Complications and their management are very challenging. This article will comfortably sail you through various aspects of management of brain cancers.

It has high rates of recurrence despite neurosurgery, chemotherapy targeted therapy and radiotherapy. It is diligent endeavor of neurosurgeon and neurooncologist to make decision for patients who present with recurrence of this evil disease many times. This article is an attempt to delineate clinical spectrum molecular types character of this disease with a clinical experience of professionals dealing with this glioblastoma. Methods: We have clinically examined patients in Neuro oncology department and Neurosurgery Department and provided best possible service to patients according to current evidence-based medicine. The modern guidelines have been followed in practice. We have been conducting meticulous discussion regarding glioblastoma and getting help from international experts for decision making and treatment planning of individual patients. A case was discussed by corresponding author in European School of Oncology live session. Results: Majority of patients are returning back to Neuro physicians Neurosurgeons with recurrence of brain tumor with worsened health and debilitating morbidity. Conclusion: Brain tumor scientific knowledge needs to be upgraded with biomarkers, new approach and newer drugs and surgical protocols.

"147","Clinical correlation of plasma amino acid profile of post-surgical gastric cancer patients and metastatic gastric cancer patients for establishing biomarker of metastasis","Abstract: Objectives: This research is aimed to evaluate plasma free amino acid in gastric cancer patients without metastasis (early gastric cancer post gastrectomy) and with metastasis (advanced gastric cancer). Amino acids level of postoperative gastric cancer (M0) patients are compared with metastatic gastric cancer (M1) patients in search of biomarker which can predict the metastasis of gastric cancer. We have made clinical correlation of patients’ vital signs, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature, disease stages, chief complaints, complications and survival curve within light of metastatic and nonmetastatic domain. Background: Majority of cancer patients are diagnosed after seeding of metastatic cells to adjacent organs and distant sites. At this point, treatment is palliative and supportive. The cellular propagation of cancer cells and tumor micro-environment plays vital role in genesis of gastric cancer. Genetic alteration leading to faulty nucleotides to amino acids, then to protein, and finally formation of tumor is the natural sequence of pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Prediction of metastasis by use of plasma free amino acid profile may be of great significance because it will help to tailor the patient specific cancer treatment. Plasma Amino acids are ideal for being developed as tool for prediction of metastasis as they are affordable, less expensive and convenient. Method: This study includes total 54 patients, among which 27 had metastasis of Gastric cancer and rest 27 had undergone gastric surgery at early stage with no recurrence at the time of the study. Twenty-three amino acids were studied. Student’s t test was performed to find out statistically significant values of amino acids. The p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Amino acids with significant p values were investigated with multivariate logistic regression. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS DA) was done using Microsoft SPSS 23 version software®. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) was estimated, values ≥ 1 was considered statistically significant. Result: Performance Score (PS) (p= 0.004) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p= 0.035) were statistically significant between M0 and M1 groups. Staging (I, II vs. III, IV) (p< 0.001) was significant. Seven amino acids, Asp, Cys, Hcy, His, Leu, Orn and Ser were significant between M0 and M1 in first month evaluation. Eight amino acids, Cys, Hcy, His, Leu, Met, Thr, Trp and Tyr were significant between M0 and M1 in sixth month evaluation. PLS DA regression analysis, VIP test showed Cys, Ser, Hcy, Thr, His, Met, Tyr, Trp to be more important amino acids of significance. Kaplan Meier Overall Survival (OS) = 34.979 months. Mean survival time in M0 was 43.53± 1.741 months. Mean survival in M1 was 26.29± 2.635 months. Conclusion: We found BMI and PS as most important variables in defining and determining the disease status of gastric cancer patients. Nutrition and physical activity is very much characteristic of disease outcome from a physician’s perspective. This study propounds amino acids can be valuable biomarkers of predictive and prognostic importance in metastasis in gastric cancer patients.

This monitoring framework developed by CCAFS is meant to be deployed annually across the global network of Climate-Smart Villages to gather field-based evidence by tracking the progress on: adoption of CSA practices and technologies, as well as access to climate information services and  their related impacts at household level and farm level  The CSA framework allows to address three key research questions: Who within each CSV community adopts which CSA technologies and practices and which are their motivations, enabling factors? To which extent farmers access and use climate information services?   Which are the gender-disaggregated perceived effects of CSA options on farmers’ livelihood, agricultural, food security and adaptive capacity, and on key gender dimensions (participation in decision making, participation in CSA implementation and dis-adoption, control and access over resources and labour).   Which are the CSA performance, synergies and trade-offs found at farm level?    (Note that this 3d. question was not addressed in this specific Basona Werana 2021 monitoring, as farm level data were not collected)   The CSA framework proposes a small set of standard Core Indicators linked to the research questions, and Extended indicators covering aspects related to the enabling environment.  At household level (17 Core indicators):  7 Core Uptake indicators (they track CSA Implementation and adoption drivers; CSA dis-adoption and drivers; Access to climate information services and agro-advisories, Capacity to use them and constraining factors).   10 Core Outcome indicators (they track farmers perceptions on the effects of CSA practices on their Livelihoods, Food Security and Adaptive Capacity and on Gender dimensions.  Those include namely: CSA effect on yield/production, on Income, on Improved Food Access and Food Diversity, on Vulnerability to weather related shocks and on Changes in agricultural activities induced by access to climate information.   Four are Gender related Outcome indicators (Decision-making on CSA implementation or dis-adoption, Participation in CSA implementation, CSA effect on labor, Decision making and control on CSA generated income).   An additional set of complementary Extended indicators allows to determine and track changes in enabling conditions and farmers characteristics such as: Livelihood security, Financial enablers, Food security, Frecuency of climate events, Coping strategies, Risk Mitigation Actions, Access to financial services and Training, CSA Knowledge and Learning.    At farm level, 7 CORE indicators   7 Core indicators are used to determine the CSA performance of the farms as well as synergies and trade-offs among the three pillars (productivity, adaptation and mitigation, via farm model analysis).   This integrated framework is associated with a cost-effective data collection App (Geofarmer) that allowed capturing information in almost real time. The survey questionnaire is structured around different thematic modules.    For the implementation in the context of the EU-IFAD/CCAFS project, some slight changes were made to the questionnaire in order to focus the data collection on tackling:  The impacts of Climate events   Farmers’ access and use of CIS   Farmer’s implementation of CSA practices, and   the perceived household level outcomes related to the implementation of CSA practices in the two targetted Ethiopian CSVs.   The adjusted survey questionnaire includes the following thematic modules:   -M1A Demographic (few additional questions not included in the “MASTER” CSA monitoring questionnaire were added coming from Rhomis)   -M1D Financial services (reduced set of original questions from the Financial Master)   -M2, Climate events (no changes made)   -M3, Climate Information Services   -M5, CSA practices (no changes made)  ** The Module Food Security from the Master questionnaire of the CSA framework was not included.

These include the provision of iron and folic acid (IFA) and calcium supplements, interpersonal counseling on diet during pregnancy and consumption of IFA and calcium, community mobilization, and adequate weight-gain monitoring during pregnancy. A&T is a global initiative that supports the scaling up of nutrition interventions to save lives, prevent illnesses, and contribute to healthy growth and development through improved maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, and complementary feeding practices. Using a cluster-randomized evaluation design, the primary objectives of the A&T evaluation study in India are to answer the following questions: 1) Can the coverage and utilization of key maternal nutrition interventions be improved by integrating nutrition-focused social behavior change (SBC) communication and systems strengthening approaches into antenatal care (ANC) services under the RMNCH program? 2) What factors affect the effective integration of maternal nutrition interventions into a well-established government ANC service delivery platform under the RMNCH program? 3) What are the impacts of the program on i) consumption of diversified foods and adequate intake of micronutrient, protein, and energy compared to recommended intake; ii) intake of IFA and calcium supplements during pregnancy; iii) weight gain monitoring; and iv) early initiation of breastfeeding. As with the main impact evaluation, the nested cohort surveys used the same 26 blocks in Uttar Pradesh. Thirteen blocks from two districts (Kanpur Dehat and Unnao) were randomly allocated to receive intensified maternal nutrition interventions.

These include the provision of iron and folic acid (IFA) and calcium supplements, interpersonal counseling on diet during pregnancy and consumption of IFA and calcium, community mobilization, and adequate weight-gain monitoring during pregnancy.  A&T is a global initiative that supports the scaling up of nutrition interventions to save lives, prevent illnesses, and contribute to healthy growth and development through improved maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, and complementary feeding practices. Using a cluster-randomized evaluation design, the primary objectives of the A&T evaluation study in India are to answer the following questions: 1) Can the coverage and utilization of key maternal nutrition interventions be improved by integrating nutrition-focused social behavior change (SBC) communication and systems strengthening approaches into antenatal care (ANC) services under the RMNCH program? 2) What factors affect the effective integration of maternal nutrition interventions into a well-established government ANC service delivery platform under the RMNCH program? 3) What are the impacts of the program on i) consumption of diversified foods and adequate intake of micronutrient, protein, and energy compared to recommended intake; ii) intake of IFA and calcium supplements during pregnancy; iii) weight gain monitoring; and iv) early initiation of breastfeeding.

This monitoring framework developed by CCAFS is meant to be deployed annually across the global network of Climate-Smart Villages to gather field-based evidence by tracking the progress on: adoption of CSA practices and technologies, as well as access to climate information services and  their related impacts at household level and farm level  This framework proposes standard Descriptive Indicators to track changes in: 5 enabling dimensions that might affect adoption patterns,   a set of 5 CORE indicators at Household level to assess perceived effects of CSA practices on Food Security, Productivity, Income and Climate vulnerability and   4 CORE indicators on Gender aspects (Participation in decision-making, Participation in implementation, Access/control over Resources and work time).   At farm level, 7 CORE indicators are suggested to determine farms CSA performance, as well as synergies and trade-offs among the three pillars.   This integrated framework is associated with a cost-effective data collection App (Geofarmer) that allowed capturing information in almost real time.  The framework responds to three main research questions: Within each CSV community, who adopts which CSA technologies and practices and what are their motivations, enabling/constraining factors?   What are the gender-disaggregated perceived effects of CSA options on farmers’ livelihood (agricultural production, income, food security, food diversity and adaptive capacity) and on key gender dimensions (participation in decision-making, participation in CSA implementation and dis-adoption, control and access over resources and labour)?   How does CSA perform at farm level, and what synergies and trade-offs exist (whole farm model analysis)?  The survey questionnaire is structured around different thematic modules (M1A Demographic, M1B Farming system, M1C Financial services, M2 Climate events, M3, Climate Information Services, M4 Food Security, M5 CSA practices) whose questions allow assessing standard CSA metrics and the specific indicators associated with the research questions 1 and 2. Data required for assessing farm level CSA performance are collected through the Farm, the Crop, the animals and the Tree Calculator modules.

"172","A Comprehensive Global Database of Tailings Flows","Tailings are finely ground waste rock produced as a by-product of standard mining projects as well as some industrial and power plant operations. Tailings are conventionally impounded behind a dam that is raised perpetually insofar as operations continue, thus amassing large volumes of materials (sometimes including supernatant pond water) in the process. The failures of some tailings impoundments have triggered downstream mass movements that have caused human, economic and environmental impacts, thus inviting considerable public attention and scrutiny. Developing a detailed inventory of these “tailings flows” facilitates a better understanding of the magnitude-frequency statistics, preconditioning and trigger variables, breach-outflow processes and downstream runout behaviour. Upon screening over 350 historical waste impoundment failure incidents in pre-existing secondary datasets, we have developed a comprehensive global database of 63 tailings flows from 1928-2020 while following strict case selection criteria with the support of satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs) and source literature. Using a novel runout zonation method, the satellite images and DEMs were analyzed on geographic information systems (GIS) platforms to independently estimate runout distances, inundation areas and travel path angles of tailings flows. Depending on data availability or quality, we also summarized the background information, impoundment conditions and geotechnical indices to provide site-specific context to case histories. The collated data is aimed to (i) broaden the scholarly understanding of tailings breach-runout behaviour, (ii) provide comprehensive documentation while assessing the limitations of data availability and/or quality in the public domain and (iii) establish a consistent framework for reporting various properties of tailings dam failures and tailings flows. Lastly, we note that the data should be treated with prudence. Tailings impoundments are highly variable depending on the locality, and site-specific conditions exert strong controls on post-breach behaviour. As such, it is recommended that our database be used purely as a basis for screening-level assessments, case analog comparisons and academic research. For site-specific prediction studies undertaken by practitioners, targeted field observations, laboratory investigations and numerical models are essential.","Earth and Environmental Sciences; Engineering","Tailings dam breaches, tailings flows, runout behaviour, liquefaction, mine waste, mass movements","2021-06-18","Rana, Nahyan M.

"173","Investigating $f(R)$ gravity and cosmologies","The f (R) theory of gravity is an extended theory of gravity that is based on general relativity in the simplest case of $f(R) = R$. This theory extends such a function of the Ricci scalar into arbitrary functions that are not necessarily linear, i.e. could be of the form $f(R) = \alpha R^{2}$. The action for such a theory would be $S_{EH} = \frac{1}{2k} \int f(R) + L^{m}\; d^{4}x\sqrt{−g}$, where $S_{EH}$ is the Einstein-Hilbert action for our theory, $g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu}$ and $L^{m}$ is the Lagrangian density for matter. In this paper, we will look at some of the physical implications of such a theory, and the importance of such a theory in cosmology and in understanding the geometric nature of such f (R) theories of gravity.

We use publicly available scooter trip generation data for Louisville, KY and Minneapolis, MN and publicly available data on land use characteristics. The model shows that scooter trip generations are associated with higher employment densities, higher densities of entertainment land uses (bars and clubs), and in some specifications higher densities of eating establishments and university buildings. We establish that using the regression results to predict out of sample gives predictions that correspond well to observed scooter trip generations in Austin, TX. Because scooter trip data are not available for research in California, we use the Minneapolis model to predict scooter trips as a function of land use characteristics in California census tracts. The results yield a promising screening method that can highlight census tracts with land use characteristics that are potentially supportive of micro-mobility and non-automobile short-trip travel. We recommend that such a screening method can be a first step in more detailed analyses of planning programs or infrastructure that could support non-automobile short-trip travel.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-01-15","Boarnet, Marlon (University of Southern California) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0890-347X","Brinkerhoff, Cort","Boarnet, Marlon, 2021, ""Replication Data for: A National Study of Dockless Transportation: Land Use and Demographic Correlates of Trip Hotspots and Mode Shift"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/B2LJSB, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:OnqkNQqLxVwYYtP638UY5g== [fileUNF]","c(""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(4, 2, 13, 18, 4, 22, 22, NA)","c(26, 282, 580, 23190, 8031, 307800, 139944, NA)"

The purpose of this study is to develop, validate and translate into multiple languages a measure of dyspnea for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) that more readily meets the criteria for large clinical trials. The Yount et al. study examined the psychometric performance of two IRT measures of dyspnea and related functional limitations in patients with COPD and simulated computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of the banks to determine the number of questions required to achieve high precision. The Choi et al. study reports the development of an item bank for dyspnea severity and related functional limitations on the basis of a PRO conceptual framework derived from patient input.

"206","Replication Data for Commodity Shocks and Incumbency Effects","Why do incumbents enjoy an electoral advantage in some political settings but suffer from a disadvantage in others? We propose a novel explanation linking variation in incumbency effects with exogenous commodity shocks. While voters attempt to sanction incumbents for economic performance, changes in commodity prices affect their evaluations and condition the electoral fortunes of incumbents vis-à-vis challengers. We test our argument in Brazilian municipalities, combining a plausibly exogenous measure of variation in commodity prices with a close election regression discontinuity design. Our results show that increases in the price of agricultural commodities greatly enhance the prospects of incumbents, while negative shocks exacerbate their incumbency disadvantage, especially in rural municipalities. Further investigation suggests that commodity shocks do not operate via voter learning about candidate quality, changes in the pool of candidates, shifts in voter preferences, or strategic elite investments. Instead, we find suggestive evidence that commodity shocks affect voters’ evaluations through their effect on local economic growth.

Yet, we have limited knowledge about the determinants of branches’ varying income levels in federal contexts. To address this shortage, this article elucidates why branches receive donations from citizens and businesses to different degrees. I hypothesise that party competition at the state level, the difference in regional economic performance and parties’ historical legacies can account for the level of branches’ donation revenue. Analysing German statewide party branches’ income from 2009 to 2017, this study finds support for the facilitating impact of state and federal electoral contests on donation levels. Regional economic disparities, by contrast, only marginally affect donation revenues. At the same time, parties’ path-dependent developments help explain asymmetries in average revenue levels between western and eastern branches. The study’s findings suggest that intense regional party competition contributes to branches’ financial independence within the statewide party organisation.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-13","Jacob, Marc (ETH Zürich) - ORCID: 0000-0001-8267-1956","Jacob, Marc","Jacob, Marc, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Financing party branches: Evidence from the German federal system"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/97EDVS, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:8T5hIoZeuyDN24Sajj+lew== [fileUNF]","c(""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"")","c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA)","c(16, 8, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(791, 800, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"

Herein, we engineered photosynthesis microcapsules (PMCs) for creating hyperoxia microenvironment and induction of ferroptosis in melanoma based on the discovery of radiation-hyperoxia induced lipid peroxidation (RHILP). The PMCs were constructed by encapsulation of cyanobacteria and upconversion nanoparticles in alginate microcapsules for photosynthesis in chloroplast, which was driven by red light converted from bio-transparent near infrared II photons. Combination of PMCs and X rays evoked a RHILP effect and ferroptosis in melanoma cells and xenografts, as evidenced by ferrous ion release into cytoplasm, glutathione depletion, and suppression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Consequently, X ray-hyperoxia treatment improved the survival rate of melanoma-bearing mice and suppressed tumor metastases. Overall, our findings provide opportunities to overcome melanoma resistances and will inspire the exploration of oncological treatments.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",NA,"2021-07-01","Jiang, Jun (Soochow University)","Jiang, Jun","Jiang, Jun, 2021, ""Construction of Hyperoxia Microenvironment for Activation of Ferroptosis in Radiotherapy"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WV8AV7, Harvard Dataverse, V3","c(""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"

In fact, due to medical necessity, millions of people around the world are now equipped with prosthetic devices to restore lost function, and the DIY movement is growing to improve the body to create new senses or to improve current senses ""beyond normal"". From prosthetic limbs, artificial cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, brain-computer implants, cochlear implants, retinal prostheses, magnets as implants, exoskeletons and many other improvements, the human body becomes more mechanical and computational, and therefore less biological. This trend will continue to accelerate once the body is transformed into information processing technology, which ultimately calls one's sense of identity and what it means to be human. This article evaluates ""cyborg enhancement technologies"" with an emphasis on technological brain enhancements and the creation of new senses - the benefits of which can allow direct implantation of information into the brain, editing memories, wireless brain connection - brain communication and a wide range of sensory information to explore and experience.

Can parties exploit this uncertainty to shape public opinion? I present a spatial preference model for policy proposals with uncertain outcomes. Empirically, I conduct a large pre-registered survey experiment where I present respondents with predictions about the effects of three policy proposals. The findings show that respondents update their attitudes to the proposals as their beliefs about outcomes change and that partisan senders are no less able to influence beliefs than non-partisan experts. Contrary to previous research, respondents discount outcome uncertainty by giving equal weight to conflicting optimistic and pessimistic predictions.

"232","Replication Data for: Are Politicians More Responsive Towards Men’s or Women’s Service Delivery Requests? A Survey Experiment with Ugandan Politicians","This study examines whether politicians exhibit gender bias in responsiveness to constituents’ requests for public service delivery improvements in Uganda. We leverage an in-person survey experiment conducted with 333 subnational politicians, of which 1/3 are elected to women’s reserved seats. Politicians hear two constituents request improvements in staff absenteeism in their local school and health clinic and must decide how to allocate a fixed (hypothetical) budget between the two improvements.

"236","Replication Data for: Good Times and Bad Apples: Rebel Recruitment in Crackdown and Truce","Even in long-running civil conflicts, governments may permit rebels to recruit and gather resources freely during years-long truce periods. Scholars and policymakers assume that these periods of forbearance allow rebel organizations to gather strength unchecked. Instead, with innovative evidence from five conflict zones in Northeast India, I show how leniency can actually undermine rebel organizations in the long run. Despite rebel leaders' best efforts, safety and comfort attract selfish opportunists who may later desert in battle, defect to the enemy, or abuse civilians. First, I show experimentally that the benefits of leniency disproportionately attract low-commitment recruits. By sampling in local recruitment hotspots, I gathered nearly 400 likely rebel recruits, testing their motivations with attitudinal questions and a conjoint survey experiment. Second, I conducted dozens of qualitative interviews with rebel leaders, rebel soldiers, and civilian observers, tracking how truce periods altered rebel recruitment and behavioral patterns over time.

In this short article, we introduce a new zip code-level measure, racial flux, that accounts for how contexts differ between worker and resident populations. We merge our measure with survey data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, and show that greater racial flux --- more Black workers relative to Black residents in a zip code --- is associated with more conservative voting behaviors and racial attitudes among whites who live in the zip code. Our study suggests that whites are as politically responsive to the presence of non-resident minorities as they are resident minorities. More work is needed on measuring racial context, and on exploring the contours of how and why context affects political preferences.","Social Sciences",NA,"2020-10-12","Hamel, Brian (University of California, Los Angeles)                                                    Wilcox-Archuleta, Bryan","Hamel, Brian","Hamel, Brian; Wilcox-Archuleta, Bryan, 2020, ""Replication Data for: Black Workers in White Places: Daytime Racial Diversity and White Public Opinion"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FMOR6K, Harvard Dataverse, V3","c(""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"")","c(2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"

Biodiversity is the foundation of agricultural productivity and contributes essential ecosystem functions and services to food systems. The UBC Farm provides a unique opportunity to monitor the biodiversity important for agroecosystem food production and other ecosystem services on a working, diversified, and organic farm and pilot new technologies and survey techniques to assess agrobiodiversity. The Long-Term Biodiversity Monitoring program focuses on assessing bumble bees, earthworms, forest and crop plants, birds, mammals, bats, and soil fauna each year. The program aims to improve understanding of the biodiversity at the UBC Farm, how it is changing over time, and how this affects important ecosystem services (the benefits people receive from the natural environment) that benefit people, help crops grow, and contribute to overall agroecosystem sustainability.","Agricultural Sciences; Earth and Environmental Sciences","biodiversity, birds, mammals, plants, Insecta, monitoring, earthworms, Chiroptera","2020-02-18","Mitchell, Matthew G.

"312","Replication Data for: Peaceful Dyads: A Territorial Perspective","Many dyads develop peaceful relationships, avoiding war for long, historical periods. Are such dyads common? How many exist, and why have they never fought? This study provides a territorial perspective on peaceful dyads, defined as those that never fight a war over a given historical period. It tests two explanations for why peaceful dyads exist: the territorial peace and the democratic peace. A series of hypotheses test the relative ability of these two theories to account for peaceful dyads. The tests employ three samples—all dyads, politically relevant dyads, and grievance dyads—from 1816-2001, with an emphasis on the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. Through our analyses, we reach three major findings. First, the absence of territorial conflict—but not democracy—predicts peaceful dyads. Second, the absence of territorial disagreements appears in the vast majority (i.e., 85-96%) of peaceful dyads. Finally, approximately, 93-99% of democratic dyads lack any territorial disagreements. This implies that democratic dyads are peaceful because they face different issues than non-democratic dyads—ones less likely to undermine the development of peaceful, dyadic relationships. We explore the research and theoretical implications of these findings, as we discuss where research might go next.","Social Sciences","democratic peace, territorial peace, interstate peace","2021-07-12","Owsiak, Andrew (University of Georgia)                                                    Vasquez, John A.

"314","Replication Data for: Mobilizing the Underrepresented: Electoral Systems and Gender Inequality in Political Participation","To study the political mobilization of underrepresented groups, this paper examines the effect of electoral systems on gender equality in voting. Theoretically, I argue that replacing a plurality electoral system with proportional representation (PR) gives party elites greater incentives to mobilize women to vote in all but the most competitive districts under plurality rule. Yet, they need to tap into women's networks to succeed with such mobilizing efforts. Empirically, I isolate the causal effect of PR by studying an imposed shift from plurality to PR in Norwegian municipalities. Using a difference-in-differences design, I estimate that the move from plurality to PR substantially decreased gender inequality in voting. The effect is most pronounced in previously uncompetitive municipalities and where women's networks are present. This study thus demonstrates how the social environment conditions the effect of democratic institutions on the political participation of marginalized groups.","Social Sciences","Electoral system, Voter turnout, Political participation, Gender inequality, Gender gap, Political marginalization, Women’s movement, Women’s representation, Political competition, Women’s suffrage","2021-03-14","Skorge, Øyvind Søraas (Bjørknes University College and Institute for Social Research, Oslo) - ORCID: 0000-0001-8658-7567","Skorge, Øyvind Søraas","Skorge, Øyvind Søraas, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Mobilizing the Underrepresented: Electoral Systems and Gender Inequality in Political Participation"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/T0R1GE, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:DnP+v9ALdDOlofQE8ceqfQ== [fileUNF]","c(""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(2, 2, 2, 2, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(561, 594, 657, 703, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)"

"319","Replication Data for: Workplace Contact and Support for Anti-Immigration Parties","How does an increased presence of immigrants in the workplace affect anti-immigration voting behavior? While cooperative interactions between natives and immigrants can reduce intergroup prejudice, immigrant co-workers might be regarded as a threat to native-born workers' labor market position. We combine detailed Swedish workplace data with precinct-level election outcomes for a large anti-immigration party (the Sweden Democrats) to study how the share of non-Europeans in the workplace affects opposition to immigration. We show that the share of non-Europeans in the workplace has a negative effect on support for the Sweden Democrats and that this effect is solely driven by same-skill contact in small workplaces. We interpret these results as supporting the so-called contact hypothesis: that increased interactions with minorities can reduce opposition to immigration among native-born voters, which, in turn, leads to lower support for anti-immigration parties.

"320","Mortality, overall and specific infectious complications in parenteral nutrition: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analysis","Objectives: To examine whether parenteral nutrition is associated with increased risk of mortality or infectious complications in hospitalized patients compared with other nutritional support strategies. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, SCOPUS, Clinical Trials and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies published until July 2020 exploring the effect of parenteral nutrition on mortality and infectious complications. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies: Randomised controlled trials or observational studies with parallel groups comparing parenteral nutrition with any comparator that included data regarding mortality or infections rate. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Fixed effects meta-analysis were performed to compare the parenteral nutrition group with the control group. Trial sequential analysis was used to identify if current results are enough for definitive conclusions. Results: Of 79 included studies from patients receiving parenteral nutrition versus other strategies, we were able to perform meta-analysis from 64 randomised controlled trials. Parenteral nutrition was not associated with higher risk of mortality (risk relative 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.07), with low inconsistency across trial results (I² = 26%). On the other hand, parenteral nutrition was associated with higher risk of overall infection (risk relative 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.36), with low inconsistency across trial results (I² = 26%). Regarding specific infectious complications, parenteral nutrition was specifically associated with abdominal infection, catheter infection and fungaemia, but not pneumonia. The trial sequential analysis shows that there is sufficient data to perform numerical conclusions about mortality, overall and abdominal infectious complications, but not for other specific infectious complications. Most of the included trials were ate high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Conclusions: This study suggests that although parenteral nutrition is not associated with greater mortality in hospitalized patients, it is associated with infectious complications. Through trial sequential analysis could reach definite conclusions about survival and overall infection.
