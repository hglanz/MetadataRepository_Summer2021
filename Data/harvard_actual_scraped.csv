"1",1,"Replication Data for: The Politics of Interruptions: Gendered Disruptions of Legislative Speeches","Floor time in legislatures is a valuable commodity that legislators use to gain political capital and electoral benefits. There are well-known political and institutional barriers to participation, but these do not explain gender differences in access to floor time. In this paper, we look at the role interruptions play as potential barriers to floor time. We explore how women strategically react to these barriers, and consider how these reactions ultimately lead to gendered differences in legislative participation. Our findings show that differences in participation across genders are a consequence of rational strategies followed by women who sacrifice floor time in the short term to avoid the long-term consequences of challenging gendered barriers, such as interruptions. We test our argument using original data on legislative speeches from the Ecuadorian Congress between 1988 and 2018.","Social Sciences","Gender, Legislative Speeches, Interruptions",NA,"Vallejo Vera, Sebastian (Tecnológico de Monterrey) - ORCID: 0000-0002-5848-7400                                                    Gómez Vidal, Analía (Inter-American Development Bank)","Vallejo Vera, Sebastian","Vallejo Vera, Sebastian; Gómez Vidal, Analía, 2021, ""Replication Data for: The Politics of Interruptions: Gendered Disruptions of Legislative Speeches"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6IRAEM, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"", ""data_empirics_count_0.Rdata"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"11",11,"Replication Data for: The negative consequences of sports gambling opportunities on human capital formation: evidence from Spain","This repository contains the replication package--the instructions, data and code-- necessary to replicate the results presented in Espadafor & Martínez (2021). The proliferation of on-site betting shops has received enormous public attention, becoming one of the most alarming health policy issues in contemporary cities. However, there is little evidence on whether its growing presence nearby vulnerable populations produce social harm beyond its known adverse individual effects. This study provides new evidence on the negative societal effects of betting houses. Our research design takes advantage of a new wave of openings in Madrid (Spain), which created a sudden increase in the supply of on-site gambling. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that new betting houses decline nearby high schools' educational performance, especially in public schools in less advantaged areas. This effect is neither trivial nor diminishing with time. This evidence suggests that betting houses increase inequality of educational opportunities. The ubiquity of betting houses around vulnerable populations in multiple regions drives us to think that these findings have relevant policy implications for many countries currently designing policies tackling the increase of problem gambling.

WX21 was fielded June 9 – July 17, 2021 using an online questionnaire that was completed by 1,550 US adults (age 18+) that were recruited from an Internet panel that matches the characteristics of the U.S. population as estimated in the U.S. Census. WX17 and WX18 were designed to establish baseline measures of the extent to which US adults receive, understand, and respond to severe weather forecasts and warnings; WX19 and WX20 were designed to continue and, in some cases, refine the measurement of these concepts. WX21 continues to measure these core concepts, giving us 5 years of consistent data to continue measuring change. Additionally, WX21 measured public trust in the National Weather Service (NWS), extreme weather and climate risk perceptions, risk literacy, interpretations of probabilistic language, and interpretation of longer-range severe weather forecasts (like those from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center).","Social Sciences",NA,NA,"Ripberger, Joseph (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Krocak, Makenzie (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Silva, Carol (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Jenkins-Smith, Hank (University of Oklahoma)","Krocak, Makenzie","Ripberger, Joseph; Krocak, Makenzie; Silva, Carol; Jenkins-Smith, Hank, 2021, ""WX21"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QYZLSO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:Z2TF/SuLbAgTzrdUBe1+rw== [fileUNF]","c(""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"")","c(1, 0, 0, NA)","c(212, NA, NA, NA)","c(1550, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

We respond in two ways. First, we point out that principles of good science dictate that we discard dispute cases that either cannot be substantiated by the historical record or that do not meet dataset coding rules; we also discuss the ten-thousand-plus changed values PDKM still have not examined. Second, contrary to PDKM, we demonstrate how data differences greatly affect previous studies by returning again to the replications. There were substantial errors in both of PDKM’s replications, and these errors led them to incorrect inferences.

They contend that, in several instances, analyses with their revised data lead to substantively different inferences. Here, we review GML's MID drop and merge recommendations and reevaluate the substantive impact of their changes. We are in agreement with about 76 percent of the recommended drops and merges. However, we find that some of the purported overturned findings in GML's replications are not due to their data, but rather to the strategies they employ for replication. We reexamine these findings and conclude that the remaining differences in inference stemming from the variations in the MID data are rare and modest in scope.

"22",22,"The Effect of Core Values on Support for Electoral Reform: Evidence from Two Survey Experiments","A central tenet in the electoral systems subfield is that parties seek desired outcomes via the strategic adoption of electoral rules. Such partisan self-interest, however, is merely one explanation for reform: a second is that an actor may attempt to maximize her core values, which constitute her perception of the ‘common good.’ Although the extant literature has demonstrated the motivational power of core values, their effect on electoral rule choice has not been tested. Using a factorial experimental design that manipulates the partisan- and values-implications of a fictitious reform proposal, I find evidence in favor of core values: not only do they have an effect net of partisan concerns, but they also attenuate the effect of partisan self-interest when the two predispositions countervail. The results provide evidence that partisan self-interest offers an incomplete picture: actors hold—and pursue through electoral reform—objectives that are not immediately partisan in nature.

The intervention facilitated critical discussion about nutrition and media, mentored by the parent. Results showed that youths’ increases in fruit and vegetable consumption flowed from parent-child discussion of nutrition labels, which was predicted by child-initiated discussion, critical thinking about media sources, and critical thinking about media content. Multivariate analyses revealed that the intervention was productive for all participating age groups and for all dependent variables. The results suggest that a developmental progression from critical thinking about source to critical thinking about content affects behavior change and can be catalyzed through media literacy education and encouragement to discuss media messages (i.e. practice) with parents.

"61",61,"Auditory feedback on proprioception increases bodily awareness","Multiple studies have shown the importance of movement and physical exercise like dance for human wellbeing and mental health. Yet, factors influencing proprioception and body awareness in the context of exercise remain largely unexplored. This is mostly due to the lack of tools and techniques to record, manipulate and intervene on body awareness during real-time movements. To this end, we designed FUGA, a wearable device delivering continuous real-time auditory feedback on human gestures. Here we tested whether we could manipulate bodily awareness during physical exercise and dance using auditory feedback on proprioception. Following a within-subject design, we tested the effects of the device using different sounds in three populations of dancers: novice, amateurs and professionals. We found that across populations the wearable had a significant effect on the participant’s rating of feelings of bodily awareness, ​reward, immersion, embodiment, and self-efficacy. We discuss these results in the light of recent theories of predictive coding and active inference, emphasizing the role of action, proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback in human behavior. Building upon these results, we suggest future studies to explore the potential of auditory proprioceptive feedback for mental health.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",NA,NA,"Schoeller, Félix (MIT)","Schoeller, Félix","Schoeller, Félix, 2021, ""Auditory feedback on proprioception increases bodily awareness"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/T85DBO, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""Fuga V7.xlsx"", ""Fuga V7.xlsx"")","c(1, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

A systematic framework for combined durability-resilience assessment of an RC bridge column is presented in this article. Corrosion of steel reinforcement is the main deterioration mechanism considered for durability evaluation, and earthquakes are assumed to be the primary hazard for resilience assessment. An example bridge column with two types of cover materials – conventional concrete and ductile fiber-reinforced concrete – is considered in our study. The ductile fiber-reinforced concrete provides better durability than the conventional concrete, resulting in lower rebar mass loss at a given time. Fick’s second law of diffusion is used to model the corrosion initiation phase. A pitting corrosion model, accounting for the effects of cracking on the corrosion rate, is considered for the corrosion propagation phase. Seismic fragility curves are constructed by nonlinear dynamic analysis, incorporating the rebar mass loss, at discrete times during the life span of the bridge. The results indicate that corrosion of reinforcement increases the vulnerability of the bridge column to seismic hazard.

Candidate characteristics can shape how leaders use---and how voters react to---nonverbal cues. Drawing on role congruity expectations, we study how the use of and reactions to facial, vocal, and textual communication in political debates varies by candidate gender. Relying on full-length videos of four German federal election debates (2005--2017) and a minor party debate, we use video, audio, and text data to measure candidate facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger than her male opponents, but is just as emotive in other respects. Combining these measures of emotional expression with continuous responses recorded by live audiences, we find that voters punish Merkel for anger displays and reward her happiness and general emotional displays.

Our empirical analyses employ longitudinal data from the Arab Barometer covering 13 countries and data from the 2015 World Values Survey, which includes both Arab and non-Arab countries in order to benchmark regional developments against global patterns. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on the political effects of insecurity and oppose culturalist depictions of fixed political attitudes among Muslims in narrow perspectives on the relationship between Islam and democracy.","Social Sciences","Political values, Democracy, Political trust, Arab countries, Middle East",NA,"Cammett, Melani (Harvard University) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8745-4608                                                    Diwan (Ishac)                                                    Vartanova (Irina)","Cammett, Melani","Cammett, Melani; Diwan; Vartanova, 2021, ""Insecurity and Political Values in the Arab World"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PJF1JB, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:/WO20cP1BxeN/altyy67cA== [fileUNF]","c(""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"", ""ab-security-and-values.tab"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(22, 8, NA, NA, NA)","c(43493, 59, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

This is a sub sample of KMOS redshift one spectroscopic survey (KROSS) previously studied by \citet{GS20}. The stellar masses (M∗) of these objects were previously estimated using mass-to-light ratios derived from fitting the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies. Star formation rates were derived from the Hα luminosities. The total gas masses (Mgas) are determined by scaling relations of molecular and atomic gas \citep[][respectively] {Tacconi2018, Lagos2011}. The dynamical masses (Mdyn) are directly derived from the rotation curves (RCs) at different scale lengths (effective radius: Re, ∼2 Re and ∼3 Re) and then the dark matter fractions (fDM=1−Mbar/Mdyn) at these radii are calculated. We report that at z∼1 only a small fraction (∼5%) of our sample has a low (<20%) DM fraction within ∼ 2-3 Re. The majority (>72%) of SFGs in our sample have dark matter dominated outer disks (∼5−10 kpc) in agreement with local SFGs. Moreover, we find a large scatter in the fraction of dark matter at a given stellar mass (or circular velocity) with respect to local SFGs, suggesting that galaxies at z∼1, a) span a wide range of stages in the formation of stellar disks, b) have diverse DM halo properties coupled with baryons (2021-07-17)","Physics","Astrophysics",NA,"Sharma, Gauri (Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati) - ORCID: 0000-0002-6070-2851","Sharma, Gauri","Sharma, Gauri, 2021, ""Dark matter fraction in z ~1 star-forming galaxies"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/O1KKIV, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""GS21b_catalog.fits"", ""GS21b_catalog.fits"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"97",97,"Replication Data for: State As Salesman: International  Economic Engagement and Foreign News Coverage in China","How does an authoritarian regime cover news about foreign countries for its domestic audience? What accounts for the variation in news coverage received by different foreign countries? While existing literature points to political concerns at home, in this article, we argue that a regime's economic interests can also be a driving force: the desire to deepen its international economic engagement can motivate the regime to treat foreign countries differently in its news coverage. To test this argument, we examine foreign news coverage by China's state-run television network between 2003 and 2018. Combining textual and quantitative analysis, we find that countries with stronger economic ties with China receive more favorable news coverage. Moreover, the manipulation of coverage favorability is achieved through selective reporting: negative events such as armed conflicts receive less coverage when taking place in a country with close economic ties with China. These findings contribute to our understanding of international news flow, especially in a non-Western setting. They also demonstrate a pragmatic rather than political use of information control by an authoritarian government.","Social Sciences",NA,NA,"Liu, Hanzhang (Pitzer College) - ORCID: 0000-0003-1003-1372                                                    Chengyuan Ji (Shanghai Jiaotong University)","Liu, Hanzhang","Liu, Hanzhang; Chengyuan Ji, 2021, ""Replication Data for: State As Salesman: International Economic Engagement and Foreign News Coverage in China"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JNI6TO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:IrjAUCOaIcmFTmgI1ArimQ== [fileUNF]","c(""news_fav.tab"", ""news_fav.tab"", ""news_fav.tab"")","c(0, 0, NA)","c(66, NA, NA)","c(3022, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"112",112,"Replication Data for: The rise and fall of cryptocurrency coins and tokens (coin data)","Since Bitcoin’s introduction in 2009, interest in cryptocurrencies has soared. One manifestation of this interest has been the explosion of newly created coins and tokens. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of this burgeoning industry. We consider both cryptocurrency coins and tokens. The paper examines the dynamics of coin and token creation, competition and destruction in the cryptocurrency industry. In order to conduct the analysis, we develop a methodology to identify peaks in prices and trade volume, as well as when coins and tokens are abandoned and subsequently “resurrected”. We also study trading activity. Our data spans more than 4 years: there are 1082 coins and 725 tokens in the data. While there are some similarities between coins and tokens regarding dynamics, there are some striking differences as well. Overall, we find that 44% of publicly-traded coins are abandoned, at least temporarily. 71% of abandoned coins are later resurrected, leaving 18% of coins to fail permanently. Tokens experience abandonment less frequently, with only 7% abandonment and 5% permanent token abandonment at the end of the data. Using linear regressions, we find that market variables such as the bitcoin price are not associated with the rate of introducing new coins, though they are positively associated with issuing new tokens. We find that for both coins and tokens, market variables are positively associated with resurrection. We then examine the effect that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble in December 2017 had on the dynamics in the industry. Unlike the end of the 2013 bubble, some alternative cryptocurrencies continue to flourish after the bursting of this bubble.

"114",114,"Replication Data for: An examination of the cryptocurrency pump-and-dump ecosystem","The recent introduction of thousands of cryptocurrencies in an unregulated environment has created many opportunities for unscrupulous traders to profit from price manipulation. We quantify the scope of one widespread tactic, the “pump and dump”, in which actors coordinate to bid up the price of coins before selling at a profit. We joined all relevant channels on two popular group-messaging platforms, Telegram and Discord, and identified thousands of different pumps targeting hundreds of coins. We find that pumps are modestly successful in driving short-term price rises, but that this effect has diminished over time. We also find that the most successful pumps are those that are most transparent about their intentions. Combined with evidence of concentration among a small number of channels, we conclude that regulators have an opportunity to effectively crack down on this illicit activity that threatens broader adoption of blockchain technologies.

We examine whether Public Service Announcements (PSAs) can encourage the use of facemasks. We designed two PSAs. One PSA describes the benefits of using facemasks. The second uses a novel messenger (a retired US general) to advocate for facemasks. We conducted two studies. First, we aired our PSAs on television and surveyed residents of the media market to determine if they saw the PSA and how they felt about wearing facemasks. Second, we conducted a randomized experiment on a diverse national sample. Both studies suggest that exposure to our PSAs increased support for masks and induced greater compliance with public health advice.

Using a sample of American adult social media users, we match data from individuals’ Internet browser histories with a survey measuring the accuracy of political beliefs. We find that visits to partisan websites are at times related to misperceptions consistent with the political bias of the site. However, we do not find strong evidence that untrustworthy websites consistently relate to false beliefs. There is also little evidence that visits to less partisan, centrist news sites are associated with more accurate political beliefs about these issues, suggesting that exposure to politically neutral news is not necessarily the antidote to misinformation. Results suggest that focusing on partisan news sites—rather than untrustworthy sites—may be fruitful to understanding how media contribute to political misperceptions.","Social Sciences","Behavioral data, misinformation",NA,"Menchen-Trevino, Ericka (American University) - ORCID: 0000-0002-5029-8269                                                    Brian Weeks (University of Michigan) - ORCID: 0000-0003-2355-2302                                                    Christopher Calabrese (University of California Davis)                                                    Andreu Casas (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)                                                    Magdalena Wojcieszak (University of California Davis)","Menchen-Trevino, Ericka","Menchen-Trevino, Ericka; Brian Weeks; Christopher Calabrese; Andreu Casas; Magdalena Wojcieszak, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Partisan Media, Untrustworthy News Sites, and Political Misperceptions"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PGQUWF, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:hZeGG8FlWh04ULebck7etA== [fileUNF]","c(""replication_misperceptions_nms.sps"", ""replication_misperceptions_nms.sps"", ""replication_misperceptions_nms.sps"")","c(0, 1, NA)","c(20, NA, NA)","c(671, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"122",122,"Replication Data for: Which Narrative Strategies Durably Reduce Prejudice? Evidence From Field and Survey Experiments Supporting the Efficacy of Perspective-Getting","Exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups contribute to social and political challenges worldwide. Previous field experiments found that interpersonal conversations employing multiple narrative strategies can durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. We theoretically distinguish between three of these narrative strategies: narratives which promote analogic perspective-taking, vicarious perspective-giving, and perspective-getting. Previous research has assigned these strategies together in a compound treatment, leaving open important theoretical and practical questions about each's effectiveness. We present results from three field studies and a survey experiment that individually manipulate their presence. Across the field studies, we find omitting prompts to engage in analogic perspective-taking and vicarious perspective-giving does not diminish effects; conversations employing only perspective-getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. Results from within-subject analyses and a survey experiment similarly show that perspective-getting consistently reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple mechanisms. These results refine theoretical understandings of prejudice reduction and support facilitating perspective-getting in conversations intended to reduce exclusionary attitudes.","Social Sciences","Prejudice reduction, Field experiments, Political science",NA,"Kalla, Joshua (Yale University) - ORCID: 0000-0003-3553-3862                                                    Broockman, David (University of California, Berkeley) - ORCID: 0000-0002-0993-7073","Kalla, Joshua","Kalla, Joshua; Broockman, David, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Which Narrative Strategies Durably Reduce Prejudice?

Each map was made from 13 consecutive sets of global map swaths taken during a time period of about a sol by the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft. This dataset contains the standard resolution (0.1 degree longitude by 0.1 degree latitude, covering 180W-180E, 90S-90N) color MDGMs for MARCI subphases from P01 to J08 (Mars Year 28-33, data collected during 2006-2016). The maps are organized into ""P"" (for P01-P22), ""B"" for (B01-B22), ""G"" (for G01-G23), ""D"" (for D01-D22), ""F"" (for F01-F23) and ""J"" (for J01-J08) folders. The folders are tarred and gzipped. Information for the Mars year and solar longitude (Ls) value of each MDGM can be found from a .txt file within each subphase folder. The list of images used to construct the MDGMs can be found in the list/ subdirectory of each subphase folder. The time range covered by each subphase can be found in the summary_subphases.txt file. The Notes associated with this dataset provides additional information. The MDGMs in TIFF format, maps for 7 individual MARCI camera filters, 0.05 degree by 0.05 degree visible and color maps, and more information can be found in the original archive bundle at NASA's PDS Annex Astropedia website when the data are appended: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/MarsReconnaissanceOrbiter/MARCI/MARS-MRO-MARCI-Mars-Daily-Global-Maps. For users' convenience, the documents (readme.pdf, processing.pdf and errata.pdf) for the PDS4 archive are replicated here. The MDGMs are intended for a quick look of time-variable phenomena on Mars from day to day. The color of MDGMs results from an arbitrary color scheme that is applied across all maps, but users can apply their own color stretch using image manipulating software.

They exist and thus every treating physician and surgeon happens to come across it. We try to put major contemporary practices and facts in a single bucket from learned skills of neurology and oncology tradition and things we received as feedback from our patients in clinical settings. Purpose of this work is to refresh your knowledge and preparedness for seeing patients with brain cancer. Brain tumors are molecularly heterogeneous and their features depend upon size, site, and genetic make-up of tumor, aggressive growth, and adjacent structures. Complications and their management are very challenging. This article will comfortably sail you through various aspects of management of brain cancers.

It has high rates of recurrence despite neurosurgery, chemotherapy targeted therapy and radiotherapy. It is diligent endeavor of neurosurgeon and neurooncologist to make decision for patients who present with recurrence of this evil disease many times. This article is an attempt to delineate clinical spectrum molecular types character of this disease with a clinical experience of professionals dealing with this glioblastoma. Methods: We have clinically examined patients in Neuro oncology department and Neurosurgery Department and provided best possible service to patients according to current evidence-based medicine. The modern guidelines have been followed in practice. We have been conducting meticulous discussion regarding glioblastoma and getting help from international experts for decision making and treatment planning of individual patients. A case was discussed by corresponding author in European School of Oncology live session. Results: Majority of patients are returning back to Neuro physicians Neurosurgeons with recurrence of brain tumor with worsened health and debilitating morbidity. Conclusion: Brain tumor scientific knowledge needs to be upgraded with biomarkers, new approach and newer drugs and surgical protocols.

"147",147,"Clinical correlation of plasma amino acid profile of post-surgical gastric cancer patients and metastatic gastric cancer patients for establishing biomarker of metastasis","Abstract: Objectives: This research is aimed to evaluate plasma free amino acid in gastric cancer patients without metastasis (early gastric cancer post gastrectomy) and with metastasis (advanced gastric cancer). Amino acids level of postoperative gastric cancer (M0) patients are compared with metastatic gastric cancer (M1) patients in search of biomarker which can predict the metastasis of gastric cancer. We have made clinical correlation of patients’ vital signs, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature, disease stages, chief complaints, complications and survival curve within light of metastatic and nonmetastatic domain. Background: Majority of cancer patients are diagnosed after seeding of metastatic cells to adjacent organs and distant sites. At this point, treatment is palliative and supportive. The cellular propagation of cancer cells and tumor micro-environment plays vital role in genesis of gastric cancer. Genetic alteration leading to faulty nucleotides to amino acids, then to protein, and finally formation of tumor is the natural sequence of pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Prediction of metastasis by use of plasma free amino acid profile may be of great significance because it will help to tailor the patient specific cancer treatment. Plasma Amino acids are ideal for being developed as tool for prediction of metastasis as they are affordable, less expensive and convenient. Method: This study includes total 54 patients, among which 27 had metastasis of Gastric cancer and rest 27 had undergone gastric surgery at early stage with no recurrence at the time of the study. Twenty-three amino acids were studied. Student’s t test was performed to find out statistically significant values of amino acids. The p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Amino acids with significant p values were investigated with multivariate logistic regression. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS DA) was done using Microsoft SPSS 23 version software®. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) was estimated, values ≥ 1 was considered statistically significant. Result: Performance Score (PS) (p= 0.004) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p= 0.035) were statistically significant between M0 and M1 groups. Staging (I, II vs. III, IV) (p< 0.001) was significant. Seven amino acids, Asp, Cys, Hcy, His, Leu, Orn and Ser were significant between M0 and M1 in first month evaluation. Eight amino acids, Cys, Hcy, His, Leu, Met, Thr, Trp and Tyr were significant between M0 and M1 in sixth month evaluation. PLS DA regression analysis, VIP test showed Cys, Ser, Hcy, Thr, His, Met, Tyr, Trp to be more important amino acids of significance. Kaplan Meier Overall Survival (OS) = 34.979 months. Mean survival time in M0 was 43.53± 1.741 months. Mean survival in M1 was 26.29± 2.635 months. Conclusion: We found BMI and PS as most important variables in defining and determining the disease status of gastric cancer patients. Nutrition and physical activity is very much characteristic of disease outcome from a physician’s perspective. This study propounds amino acids can be valuable biomarkers of predictive and prognostic importance in metastasis in gastric cancer patients.

This monitoring framework developed by CCAFS is meant to be deployed annually across the global network of Climate-Smart Villages to gather field-based evidence by tracking the progress on: adoption of CSA practices and technologies, as well as access to climate information services and  their related impacts at household level and farm level  The CSA framework allows to address three key research questions: Who within each CSV community adopts which CSA technologies and practices and which are their motivations, enabling factors? To which extent farmers access and use climate information services?   Which are the gender-disaggregated perceived effects of CSA options on farmers’ livelihood, agricultural, food security and adaptive capacity, and on key gender dimensions (participation in decision making, participation in CSA implementation and dis-adoption, control and access over resources and labour).   Which are the CSA performance, synergies and trade-offs found at farm level?    (Note that this 3d. question was not addressed in this specific Basona Werana 2021 monitoring, as farm level data were not collected)   The CSA framework proposes a small set of standard Core Indicators linked to the research questions, and Extended indicators covering aspects related to the enabling environment.  At household level (17 Core indicators):  7 Core Uptake indicators (they track CSA Implementation and adoption drivers; CSA dis-adoption and drivers; Access to climate information services and agro-advisories, Capacity to use them and constraining factors).   10 Core Outcome indicators (they track farmers perceptions on the effects of CSA practices on their Livelihoods, Food Security and Adaptive Capacity and on Gender dimensions.  Those include namely: CSA effect on yield/production, on Income, on Improved Food Access and Food Diversity, on Vulnerability to weather related shocks and on Changes in agricultural activities induced by access to climate information.   Four are Gender related Outcome indicators (Decision-making on CSA implementation or dis-adoption, Participation in CSA implementation, CSA effect on labor, Decision making and control on CSA generated income).   An additional set of complementary Extended indicators allows to determine and track changes in enabling conditions and farmers characteristics such as: Livelihood security, Financial enablers, Food security, Frecuency of climate events, Coping strategies, Risk Mitigation Actions, Access to financial services and Training, CSA Knowledge and Learning.    At farm level, 7 CORE indicators   7 Core indicators are used to determine the CSA performance of the farms as well as synergies and trade-offs among the three pillars (productivity, adaptation and mitigation, via farm model analysis).   This integrated framework is associated with a cost-effective data collection App (Geofarmer) that allowed capturing information in almost real time. The survey questionnaire is structured around different thematic modules.    For the implementation in the context of the EU-IFAD/CCAFS project, some slight changes were made to the questionnaire in order to focus the data collection on tackling:  The impacts of Climate events   Farmers’ access and use of CIS   Farmer’s implementation of CSA practices, and   the perceived household level outcomes related to the implementation of CSA practices in the two targetted Ethiopian CSVs.   The adjusted survey questionnaire includes the following thematic modules:   -M1A Demographic (few additional questions not included in the “MASTER” CSA monitoring questionnaire were added coming from Rhomis)   -M1D Financial services (reduced set of original questions from the Financial Master)   -M2, Climate events (no changes made)   -M3, Climate Information Services   -M5, CSA practices (no changes made)  ** The Module Food Security from the Master questionnaire of the CSA framework was not included.

"155",155,"A&T India Maternal Nutrition Nested Cohort Study 2019: Recruitment","This dataset is the result of the household/pregnant women (PW) survey that was conducted to gather data for the nested cohort part of the impact evaluation study of the Alive & Thrive (A&T) interventions delivered through the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child Health (RMNCH) services in India. These include the provision of iron and folic acid (IFA) and calcium supplements, interpersonal counseling on diet during pregnancy and consumption of IFA and calcium, community mobilization, and adequate weight-gain monitoring during pregnancy. A&T is a global initiative that supports the scaling up of nutrition interventions to save lives, prevent illnesses, and contribute to healthy growth and development through improved maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, and complementary feeding practices. Using a cluster-randomized evaluation design, the primary objectives of the A&T evaluation study in India are to answer the following questions: 1) Can the coverage and utilization of key maternal nutrition interventions be improved by integrating nutrition-focused social behavior change (SBC) communication and systems strengthening approaches into antenatal care (ANC) services under the RMNCH program? 2) What factors affect the effective integration of maternal nutrition interventions into a well-established government ANC service delivery platform under the RMNCH program? 3) What are the impacts of the program on i) consumption of diversified foods and adequate intake of micronutrient, protein, and energy compared to recommended intake; ii) intake of IFA and calcium supplements during pregnancy; iii) weight gain monitoring; and iv) early initiation of breastfeeding. As with the main impact evaluation, the nested cohort surveys used the same 26 blocks in Uttar Pradesh. Thirteen blocks from two districts (Kanpur Dehat and Unnao) were randomly allocated to receive intensified maternal nutrition interventions.

These include the provision of iron and folic acid (IFA) and calcium supplements, interpersonal counseling on diet during pregnancy and consumption of IFA and calcium, community mobilization, and adequate weight-gain monitoring during pregnancy.  A&T is a global initiative that supports the scaling up of nutrition interventions to save lives, prevent illnesses, and contribute to healthy growth and development through improved maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, and complementary feeding practices. Using a cluster-randomized evaluation design, the primary objectives of the A&T evaluation study in India are to answer the following questions: 1) Can the coverage and utilization of key maternal nutrition interventions be improved by integrating nutrition-focused social behavior change (SBC) communication and systems strengthening approaches into antenatal care (ANC) services under the RMNCH program? 2) What factors affect the effective integration of maternal nutrition interventions into a well-established government ANC service delivery platform under the RMNCH program? 3) What are the impacts of the program on i) consumption of diversified foods and adequate intake of micronutrient, protein, and energy compared to recommended intake; ii) intake of IFA and calcium supplements during pregnancy; iii) weight gain monitoring; and iv) early initiation of breastfeeding.

This monitoring framework developed by CCAFS is meant to be deployed annually across the global network of Climate-Smart Villages to gather field-based evidence by tracking the progress on: adoption of CSA practices and technologies, as well as access to climate information services and  their related impacts at household level and farm level  This framework proposes standard Descriptive Indicators to track changes in: 5 enabling dimensions that might affect adoption patterns,   a set of 5 CORE indicators at Household level to assess perceived effects of CSA practices on Food Security, Productivity, Income and Climate vulnerability and   4 CORE indicators on Gender aspects (Participation in decision-making, Participation in implementation, Access/control over Resources and work time).   At farm level, 7 CORE indicators are suggested to determine farms CSA performance, as well as synergies and trade-offs among the three pillars.   This integrated framework is associated with a cost-effective data collection App (Geofarmer) that allowed capturing information in almost real time.  The framework responds to three main research questions: Within each CSV community, who adopts which CSA technologies and practices and what are their motivations, enabling/constraining factors?   What are the gender-disaggregated perceived effects of CSA options on farmers’ livelihood (agricultural production, income, food security, food diversity and adaptive capacity) and on key gender dimensions (participation in decision-making, participation in CSA implementation and dis-adoption, control and access over resources and labour)?   How does CSA perform at farm level, and what synergies and trade-offs exist (whole farm model analysis)?  The survey questionnaire is structured around different thematic modules (M1A Demographic, M1B Farming system, M1C Financial services, M2 Climate events, M3, Climate Information Services, M4 Food Security, M5 CSA practices) whose questions allow assessing standard CSA metrics and the specific indicators associated with the research questions 1 and 2. Data required for assessing farm level CSA performance are collected through the Farm, the Crop, the animals and the Tree Calculator modules.

"172",172,"A Comprehensive Global Database of Tailings Flows","Tailings are finely ground waste rock produced as a by-product of standard mining projects as well as some industrial and power plant operations. Tailings are conventionally impounded behind a dam that is raised perpetually insofar as operations continue, thus amassing large volumes of materials (sometimes including supernatant pond water) in the process. The failures of some tailings impoundments have triggered downstream mass movements that have caused human, economic and environmental impacts, thus inviting considerable public attention and scrutiny. Developing a detailed inventory of these “tailings flows” facilitates a better understanding of the magnitude-frequency statistics, preconditioning and trigger variables, breach-outflow processes and downstream runout behaviour. Upon screening over 350 historical waste impoundment failure incidents in pre-existing secondary datasets, we have developed a comprehensive global database of 63 tailings flows from 1928-2020 while following strict case selection criteria with the support of satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs) and source literature. Using a novel runout zonation method, the satellite images and DEMs were analyzed on geographic information systems (GIS) platforms to independently estimate runout distances, inundation areas and travel path angles of tailings flows. Depending on data availability or quality, we also summarized the background information, impoundment conditions and geotechnical indices to provide site-specific context to case histories. The collated data is aimed to (i) broaden the scholarly understanding of tailings breach-runout behaviour, (ii) provide comprehensive documentation while assessing the limitations of data availability and/or quality in the public domain and (iii) establish a consistent framework for reporting various properties of tailings dam failures and tailings flows. Lastly, we note that the data should be treated with prudence. Tailings impoundments are highly variable depending on the locality, and site-specific conditions exert strong controls on post-breach behaviour. As such, it is recommended that our database be used purely as a basis for screening-level assessments, case analog comparisons and academic research. For site-specific prediction studies undertaken by practitioners, targeted field observations, laboratory investigations and numerical models are essential.","Earth and Environmental Sciences; Engineering","Tailings dam breaches, tailings flows, runout behaviour, liquefaction, mine waste, mass movements",NA,"Rana, Nahyan M.

"173",173,"Investigating $f(R)$ gravity and cosmologies","The f (R) theory of gravity is an extended theory of gravity that is based on general relativity in the simplest case of $f(R) = R$. This theory extends such a function of the Ricci scalar into arbitrary functions that are not necessarily linear, i.e. could be of the form $f(R) = \alpha R^{2}$. The action for such a theory would be $S_{EH} = \frac{1}{2k} \int f(R) + L^{m}\; d^{4}x\sqrt{−g}$, where $S_{EH}$ is the Einstein-Hilbert action for our theory, $g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu}$ and $L^{m}$ is the Lagrangian density for matter. In this paper, we will look at some of the physical implications of such a theory, and the importance of such a theory in cosmology and in understanding the geometric nature of such f (R) theories of gravity.

We use publicly available scooter trip generation data for Louisville, KY and Minneapolis, MN and publicly available data on land use characteristics. The model shows that scooter trip generations are associated with higher employment densities, higher densities of entertainment land uses (bars and clubs), and in some specifications higher densities of eating establishments and university buildings. We establish that using the regression results to predict out of sample gives predictions that correspond well to observed scooter trip generations in Austin, TX. Because scooter trip data are not available for research in California, we use the Minneapolis model to predict scooter trips as a function of land use characteristics in California census tracts. The results yield a promising screening method that can highlight census tracts with land use characteristics that are potentially supportive of micro-mobility and non-automobile short-trip travel. We recommend that such a screening method can be a first step in more detailed analyses of planning programs or infrastructure that could support non-automobile short-trip travel.","Social Sciences",NA,NA,"Boarnet, Marlon (University of Southern California) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0890-347X","Brinkerhoff, Cort","Boarnet, Marlon, 2021, ""Replication Data for: A National Study of Dockless Transportation: Land Use and Demographic Correlates of Trip Hotspots and Mode Shift"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/B2LJSB, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:OnqkNQqLxVwYYtP638UY5g== [fileUNF]","c(""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"", ""2020.12.21 Data Description v.1a.tab"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(4, 2, 13, 18, 4, 22, 22, NA)","c(26, 282, 580, 23190, 8031, 307800, 139944, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"206",206,"Replication Data for Commodity Shocks and Incumbency Effects","Why do incumbents enjoy an electoral advantage in some political settings but suffer from a disadvantage in others? We propose a novel explanation linking variation in incumbency effects with exogenous commodity shocks. While voters attempt to sanction incumbents for economic performance, changes in commodity prices affect their evaluations and condition the electoral fortunes of incumbents vis-à-vis challengers. We test our argument in Brazilian municipalities, combining a plausibly exogenous measure of variation in commodity prices with a close election regression discontinuity design. Our results show that increases in the price of agricultural commodities greatly enhance the prospects of incumbents, while negative shocks exacerbate their incumbency disadvantage, especially in rural municipalities. Further investigation suggests that commodity shocks do not operate via voter learning about candidate quality, changes in the pool of candidates, shifts in voter preferences, or strategic elite investments. Instead, we find suggestive evidence that commodity shocks affect voters’ evaluations through their effect on local economic growth.

Yet, we have limited knowledge about the determinants of branches’ varying income levels in federal contexts. To address this shortage, this article elucidates why branches receive donations from citizens and businesses to different degrees. I hypothesise that party competition at the state level, the difference in regional economic performance and parties’ historical legacies can account for the level of branches’ donation revenue. Analysing German statewide party branches’ income from 2009 to 2017, this study finds support for the facilitating impact of state and federal electoral contests on donation levels. Regional economic disparities, by contrast, only marginally affect donation revenues. At the same time, parties’ path-dependent developments help explain asymmetries in average revenue levels between western and eastern branches. The study’s findings suggest that intense regional party competition contributes to branches’ financial independence within the statewide party organisation.","Social Sciences",NA,NA,"Jacob, Marc (ETH Zürich) - ORCID: 0000-0001-8267-1956","Jacob, Marc","Jacob, Marc, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Financing party branches: Evidence from the German federal system"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/97EDVS, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:8T5hIoZeuyDN24Sajj+lew== [fileUNF]","c(""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"", ""functions.R"")","c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA)","c(16, 8, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(791, 800, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

Herein, we engineered photosynthesis microcapsules (PMCs) for creating hyperoxia microenvironment and induction of ferroptosis in melanoma based on the discovery of radiation-hyperoxia induced lipid peroxidation (RHILP). The PMCs were constructed by encapsulation of cyanobacteria and upconversion nanoparticles in alginate microcapsules for photosynthesis in chloroplast, which was driven by red light converted from bio-transparent near infrared II photons. Combination of PMCs and X rays evoked a RHILP effect and ferroptosis in melanoma cells and xenografts, as evidenced by ferrous ion release into cytoplasm, glutathione depletion, and suppression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Consequently, X ray-hyperoxia treatment improved the survival rate of melanoma-bearing mice and suppressed tumor metastases. Overall, our findings provide opportunities to overcome melanoma resistances and will inspire the exploration of oncological treatments.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",NA,NA,"Jiang, Jun (Soochow University)","Jiang, Jun","Jiang, Jun, 2021, ""Construction of Hyperoxia Microenvironment for Activation of Ferroptosis in Radiotherapy"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WV8AV7, Harvard Dataverse, V3","c(""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"", ""Figure 1"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

From prosthetic limbs, artificial cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, brain-computer implants, cochlear implants, retinal prostheses, magnets as implants, exoskeletons and many other improvements, the human body becomes more mechanical and computational, and therefore less biological. This trend will continue to accelerate once the body is transformed into information processing technology, which ultimately calls one's sense of identity and what it means to be human.

The findings show that respondents update their attitudes to the proposals as their beliefs about outcomes change and that partisan senders are no less able to influence beliefs than non-partisan experts.

A Survey Experiment with Ugandan Politicians","This study examines whether politicians exhibit gender bias in responsiveness to constituents’ requests for public service delivery improvements in Uganda. We leverage an in-person survey experiment conducted with 333 subnational politicians, of which 1/3 are elected to women’s reserved seats. Politicians hear two constituents request improvements in staff absenteeism in their local school and health clinic and must decide how to allocate a fixed (hypothetical) budget between the two improvements.

"236",236,"Replication Data for: Good Times and Bad Apples: Rebel Recruitment in Crackdown and Truce","Even in long-running civil conflicts, governments may permit rebels to recruit and gather resources freely during years-long truce periods. Scholars and policymakers assume that these periods of forbearance allow rebel organizations to gather strength unchecked. Instead, with innovative evidence from five conflict zones in Northeast India, I show how leniency can actually undermine rebel organizations in the long run. Despite rebel leaders' best efforts, safety and comfort attract selfish opportunists who may later desert in battle, defect to the enemy, or abuse civilians. First, I show experimentally that the benefits of leniency disproportionately attract low-commitment recruits. By sampling in local recruitment hotspots, I gathered nearly 400 likely rebel recruits, testing their motivations with attitudinal questions and a conjoint survey experiment. Second, I conducted dozens of qualitative interviews with rebel leaders, rebel soldiers, and civilian observers, tracking how truce periods altered rebel recruitment and behavioral patterns over time.

In this short article, we introduce a new zip code-level measure, racial flux, that accounts for how contexts differ between worker and resident populations. We merge our measure with survey data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, and show that greater racial flux --- more Black workers relative to Black residents in a zip code --- is associated with more conservative voting behaviors and racial attitudes among whites who live in the zip code. Our study suggests that whites are as politically responsive to the presence of non-resident minorities as they are resident minorities. More work is needed on measuring racial context, and on exploring the contours of how and why context affects political preferences.","Social Sciences",NA,NA,"Hamel, Brian (University of California, Los Angeles)                                                    Wilcox-Archuleta, Bryan","Hamel, Brian","Hamel, Brian; Wilcox-Archuleta, Bryan, 2020, ""Replication Data for: Black Workers in White Places: Daytime Racial Diversity and White Public Opinion"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FMOR6K, Harvard Dataverse, V3","c(""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"", ""acs.RData"")","c(2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

Biodiversity is the foundation of agricultural productivity and contributes essential ecosystem functions and services to food systems. The UBC Farm provides a unique opportunity to monitor the biodiversity important for agroecosystem food production and other ecosystem services on a working, diversified, and organic farm and pilot new technologies and survey techniques to assess agrobiodiversity. The Long-Term Biodiversity Monitoring program focuses on assessing bumble bees, earthworms, forest and crop plants, birds, mammals, bats, and soil fauna each year. The program aims to improve understanding of the biodiversity at the UBC Farm, how it is changing over time, and how this affects important ecosystem services (the benefits people receive from the natural environment) that benefit people, help crops grow, and contribute to overall agroecosystem sustainability.","Agricultural Sciences; Earth and Environmental Sciences","biodiversity, birds, mammals, plants, Insecta, monitoring, earthworms, Chiroptera",NA,"Mitchell, Matthew G.

"312",312,"Replication Data for: Peaceful Dyads: A Territorial Perspective","Many dyads develop peaceful relationships, avoiding war for long, historical periods. Are such dyads common? How many exist, and why have they never fought? This study provides a territorial perspective on peaceful dyads, defined as those that never fight a war over a given historical period. It tests two explanations for why peaceful dyads exist: the territorial peace and the democratic peace. A series of hypotheses test the relative ability of these two theories to account for peaceful dyads. The tests employ three samples—all dyads, politically relevant dyads, and grievance dyads—from 1816-2001, with an emphasis on the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. Through our analyses, we reach three major findings. First, the absence of territorial conflict—but not democracy—predicts peaceful dyads. Second, the absence of territorial disagreements appears in the vast majority (i.e., 85-96%) of peaceful dyads. Finally, approximately, 93-99% of democratic dyads lack any territorial disagreements. This implies that democratic dyads are peaceful because they face different issues than non-democratic dyads—ones less likely to undermine the development of peaceful, dyadic relationships. We explore the research and theoretical implications of these findings, as we discuss where research might go next.","Social Sciences","democratic peace, territorial peace, interstate peace",NA,"Owsiak, Andrew (University of Georgia)                                                    Vasquez, John A.

"314",314,"Replication Data for: Mobilizing the Underrepresented: Electoral Systems and Gender Inequality in Political Participation","To study the political mobilization of underrepresented groups, this paper examines the effect of electoral systems on gender equality in voting. Theoretically, I argue that replacing a plurality electoral system with proportional representation (PR) gives party elites greater incentives to mobilize women to vote in all but the most competitive districts under plurality rule. Yet, they need to tap into women's networks to succeed with such mobilizing efforts. Empirically, I isolate the causal effect of PR by studying an imposed shift from plurality to PR in Norwegian municipalities. Using a difference-in-differences design, I estimate that the move from plurality to PR substantially decreased gender inequality in voting. The effect is most pronounced in previously uncompetitive municipalities and where women's networks are present. This study thus demonstrates how the social environment conditions the effect of democratic institutions on the political participation of marginalized groups.","Social Sciences","Electoral system, Voter turnout, Political participation, Gender inequality, Gender gap, Political marginalization, Women’s movement, Women’s representation, Political competition, Women’s suffrage",NA,"Skorge, Øyvind Søraas (Bjørknes University College and Institute for Social Research, Oslo) - ORCID: 0000-0001-8658-7567","Skorge, Øyvind Søraas","Skorge, Øyvind Søraas, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Mobilizing the Underrepresented: Electoral Systems and Gender Inequality in Political Participation"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/T0R1GE, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:DnP+v9ALdDOlofQE8ceqfQ== [fileUNF]","c(""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"", ""all_analyses.R"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(2, 2, 2, 2, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(561, 594, 657, 703, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

While cooperative interactions between natives and immigrants can reduce intergroup prejudice, immigrant co-workers might be regarded as a threat to native-born workers' labor market position. We combine detailed Swedish workplace data with precinct-level election outcomes for a large anti-immigration party (the Sweden Democrats) to study how the share of non-Europeans in the workplace affects opposition to immigration. We show that the share of non-Europeans in the workplace has a negative effect on support for the Sweden Democrats and that this effect is solely driven by same-skill contact in small workplaces. We interpret these results as supporting the so-called contact hypothesis: that increased interactions with minorities can reduce opposition to immigration among native-born voters, which, in turn, leads to lower support for anti-immigration parties.

"320",320,"Mortality, overall and specific infectious complications in parenteral nutrition: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analysis","Objectives: To examine whether parenteral nutrition is associated with increased risk of mortality or infectious complications in hospitalized patients compared with other nutritional support strategies. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, SCOPUS, Clinical Trials and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies published until July 2020 exploring the effect of parenteral nutrition on mortality and infectious complications. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies: Randomised controlled trials or observational studies with parallel groups comparing parenteral nutrition with any comparator that included data regarding mortality or infections rate. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Fixed effects meta-analysis were performed to compare the parenteral nutrition group with the control group. Trial sequential analysis was used to identify if current results are enough for definitive conclusions. Results: Of 79 included studies from patients receiving parenteral nutrition versus other strategies, we were able to perform meta-analysis from 64 randomised controlled trials. Parenteral nutrition was not associated with higher risk of mortality (risk relative 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.07), with low inconsistency across trial results (I² = 26%). On the other hand, parenteral nutrition was associated with higher risk of overall infection (risk relative 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.36), with low inconsistency across trial results (I² = 26%). Regarding specific infectious complications, parenteral nutrition was specifically associated with abdominal infection, catheter infection and fungaemia, but not pneumonia. The trial sequential analysis shows that there is sufficient data to perform numerical conclusions about mortality, overall and abdominal infectious complications, but not for other specific infectious complications. Most of the included trials were ate high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Conclusions: This study suggests that although parenteral nutrition is not associated with greater mortality in hospitalized patients, it is associated with infectious complications. Through trial sequential analysis could reach definite conclusions about survival and overall infection.

"331",331,"Replication Data for: Does Conjoint Analysis Mitigate Social Desirability Bias?","How can we elicit honest responses in surveys? Conjoint analysis has become a popular tool to address social desirability bias (SDB), or systematic survey misreporting on sensitive topics. However, there has been no direct evidence showing its suitability for this purpose. We propose a novel experimental design to identify conjoint analysis's ability to mitigate SDB. Specifically, we compare a standard, fully randomized conjoint design against a partially randomized design where only the sensitive attribute is varied between the two profiles in each task. We also include a control condition to remove confounding due to the increased attention to the varying attribute under the partially randomized design. We implement this empirical strategy in two studies on attitudes about environmental conservation and preferences about congressional candidates. In both studies, our estimates indicate that the fully randomized conjoint design could reduce SDB for the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the sensitive attribute by about two-thirds of the AMCE itself. While encouraging, we caution that our results are exploratory and exhibit some sensitivity to alternative model specifications, suggesting the need for additional confirmatory evidence based on the proposed design.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-06-18","Horiuchi, Yusaku (Dartmouth College) - ORCID: 0000-0003-0295-4089                                                    Markovich, Zachary (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) - ORCID: 0000-0001-5199-7048                                                    Yamamoto, Teppei (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) - ORCID: 0000-0002-8079-7675","Horiuchi, Yusaku","Horiuchi, Yusaku; Markovich, Zachary; Yamamoto, Teppei, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Does Conjoint Analysis Mitigate Social Desirability Bias?"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/4WDVDB, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""README.pdf"", ""README.pdf"", ""README.pdf"")","c(0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"332",332,"Replication Data for: Cross-Domain Topic Classification for Political Texts","We introduce and assess the use of supervised learning in cross-domain topic classification. In this approach, an algorithm learns to classify topics in a labeled source corpus and then extrapolates topics in an unlabeled target corpus from another domain. The ability to use existing training data makes this method significantly more efficient than within-domain supervised learning. It also has three advantages over unsupervised topic models: the method can be more specifically targeted to a research question and the resulting topics are easier to validate and interpret. We demonstrate the method using the case of labeled party platforms (source corpus) and unlabeled parliamentary speeches (target corpus). In addition to the standard within-domain error metrics, we further validate the cross-domain performance by labeling a subset of target-corpus documents. We find that the classifier accurately assigns topics in the parliamentary speeches, although accuracy varies substantially by topic. We also propose tools diagnosing cross-domain classification. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present two case studies on how electoral rules and the gender of parliamentarians influence the choice of speech topics.","Social Sciences",NA,NA,"Osnabrügge, Moritz (Durham University)                                                    Ash, Elliott (ETH Zurich)                                                    Morelli, Massimo (Bocconi University)","Code Ocean","Osnabrügge, Moritz; Ash, Elliott; Morelli, Massimo, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Cross-Domain Topic Classification for Political Texts"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CHTWUB, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""capsule-9e05a29c-4b3d-457e-a53a-90f4601cda2f.zip"", ""capsule-9e05a29c-4b3d-457e-a53a-90f4601cda2f.zip"", ""capsule-9e05a29c-4b3d-457e-a53a-90f4601cda2f.zip"")","c(3, 3, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"333",333,"Replication Data for: An Improved Method of Automated Nonparametric Content Analysis for Social Science","Some scholars build models to classify documents into chosen categories. Others, especially social scientists who tend to focus on population characteristics, instead usually estimate the proportion of documents in each category -- using either parametric ""classify-and-count"" methods or ""direct"" nonparametric estimation of proportions without individual classification. Unfortunately, classify-and-count methods can be highly model dependent or generate more bias in the proportions even as the percent of documents correctly classified increases. Direct estimation avoids these problems, but can suffer when the meaning of language changes between training and test sets or is too similar across categories. We develop an improved direct estimation approach without these issues by including and optimizing continuous text features, along with a form of matching adapted from the causal inference literature. Our approach substantially improves performance in a diverse collection of 73 data sets. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all ideas discussed herein.","Social Sciences","Natural language processing, Content analysis, Social media, Classification",NA,"King, Gary (Harvard University)                                                    Jerzak, Connor (Harvard University)                                                    Strezhnev, Anton (New York University)","Code Ocean","King, Gary; Jerzak, Connor; Strezhnev, Anton, 2021, ""Replication Data for: An Improved Method of Automated Nonparametric Content Analysis for Social Science"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AVNZR6, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""capsule-03f6dcc8-b7c8-4a59-97c8-7e2914d2543d.zip"", ""capsule-03f6dcc8-b7c8-4a59-97c8-7e2914d2543d.zip"", ""capsule-03f6dcc8-b7c8-4a59-97c8-7e2914d2543d.zip"")","c(2, 3, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"340",340,"Replication Data for: The Limited Scope of the Democratic Peace: What We Are Missing","The democratic peace program arguably constitutes one of the most successful empirical research programs in the discipline. Its main empirical finding motivated extensive theorizing (e.g., challengers, as well as distinct theoretical enterprises), sparked further debate about how to conceptualize and operationalize democracy, and shifted the foreign policy discourse, particularly in the United States. Lost in these successes, however, is a critical unanswered question: how much interstate peace can the democratic peace potentially explain? We explore these limits (i.e., scope, or empirical coverage) in this study. We first identify the peaceful dyadic relationships—namely those that never go to war across long historical periods. We next classify these dyads as democratic (i.e., both members are democracies) or non-democratic. The empirical analysis then examines this democracy-peace relationship across three time periods, three distinct samples (which address potential false positives), two definitions of ‘peace’, and two thresholds for democracy. Regardless of how we approach the data, only 4-26% of all peaceful dyads qualify as ‘democratic’. Because we control for the obvious trivial explanation (i.e., insufficient capabilities), some other (set of) factor(s) must account for the majority of interstate peace. We close with discussion about where future research might search for these factors, as well as the larger policy implications of the study.","Social Sciences","democratic peace","2021-07-11","Owsiak, Andy (University of Georgia)                                                    Vasquez, John A.

CIMMYT's breeding approach attempts to combine high yield potential with drought resistance for ME4. The combination of water-use efficiency and water responsive traits plus yield potential is important in drought environments where rainfall is frequently erratic across years. When rains are significantly above average in certain years, the crop must respond appropriately (water responsive) with higher yields, while expressing resistance to the wider suite of diseases that appear under more favorable conditions. Constrains including leaf, stem and yellow rusts, and Septoria spp., Fusarium spp., Pyrenophora tritici-repentis tan spot, nematodes and root rots must be considered.

It was located at the Norman E. Borlaug Experiment Station (CENEB) near Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, Mexico (lat. 27°22010″N, long. 109°55051″E, 38 masl) and had a randomized complete block design for four environments (ENV) that combined tillage and sowing irrigation practice: CTB with wet and dry sowing and PB with wet and dry sowing. The PB treatments had been under conservation agriculture for over ten years previously to the experiment. Plots were defined by N fertilizer management, with three replicates. Plots were 3 m wide (4 beds of 0.75 m width) and 10 m long, a space of 30 m2. The CTB were tilled after each crop with a disk harrow to 20 cm depth and new beds were formed. The PB were only reshaped every year in the furrow without disturbing the soil on the bed. In wet sowing, 100-120 mm irrigation was applied two-to-three weeks before sowing; in dry sowing, the field was irrigated one or two days after sowing, which provided higher soil moisture content during germination than wet sowing. Four auxiliary irrigations of 80-100 mm were applied to all plots each cycle. The N fertilizer treatments consisted of a control treatment with no N fertilizer and five treatments with different doses and divisions between first and second fertilization applied as urea. The basal N application was done on the same day as the pre-sowing irrigation, applying the fertilizer in the furrow and incorporating it through irrigation. The N application at first node was completed immediately prior to the first auxiliary irrigation. Nitrogen was applied either once (basal) or split between pre-sowing and first node (split). The data set contains daily weather data for the weather station closest to the experimental site for 2008-2018 (reference evapotranspiration, precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature), yield data (grain yield, biomass yield and straw yield for durum wheat), grain quality data (test weight and thousand kernel weight), and plant physiological data (plant stand, days from flowering to maturity, NDVI) for 2009-2018, grain and straw N data for three years, soil temperature for two years and soil moisture for one year.

Stable isotopes analysis (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen provides valuable information about trophic interactions and animal feeding habits. 2. We used near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and support vector machines (SVM) to develop a model for screening isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen (δ13C and δ15N) in samples from living animals. We applied this method on dried blood samples from birds previously analysed for δ13C and δ15N to test whether NIRS can be applied to accurately predict isotopic ratios. 3. Our results show a prediction accuracy of NIRS (R2>0.65, RMSEP<0.28) for both δ13C and δ15N, representing a 12% of the measurement range in this study. 4. Our study suggests that NIRS can provide a time- and cost-efficient method to evaluate stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen when substantial differences in δ13C or δ15N are expected, such as when discriminating among different trophic levels in diet.

"380",380,"Replication Data for: Illiberal Norm Diffusion: How Do Governments Learn to Restrict Nongovernmental Organizations?","Recent decades have witnessed a global cascade of restrictive and repressive measures against nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We theorize that state learning from observing the regional environment, rather than NGO growth per se or domestic unrest, explains this rapid diffusion of restrictions. We develop and test two hypotheses: (1) states adopt NGO restrictions in response to nonarmed bottom-up threats in their regional environment (“learning from threats”); (2) states adopt NGO restrictions through imitation of the legislative behavior of other states in their regional environment (“learning from examples”). Using an original dataset on NGO restrictions in ninety-six countries over a period of twenty-five years (1992–2016), we test these hypotheses by means of negative binomial regression and survival analyses, using spatially weighted techniques. We find very limited evidence for learning from threats, but consistent evidence for learning from examples. We corroborate this finding through close textual comparison of laws adopted in the Middle East and Africa, showing legal provisions being taken over almost verbatim from one law into another. In our conclusion, we spell out the implications for the quality of democracy and for theories of transition to a postliberal order, as well as for policy-makers, lawyers, and civil-society practitioners.

"382",382,"Replication Data for: Compliance, defiance, and the dependency trap: International Monetary Fund program interruptions and their impact on capital markets","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is infamous for its structural adjustment programs, requiring countries to undertake policy reforms in exchange for loans. Yet, not only do countries routinely fail to implement these reforms, but they also frequently return to the IMF to start the process anew. What explains this compelling case of transnational regulatory ineffectiveness? We argue that countries are caught in a dependency trap: politically contentious policy prescriptions drive non-compliance, triggering adverse market reactions that leave countries with few sources of financing beyond the IMF, leading to their eventual return to the doors of the organization for a fresh loan. Using new data on 763 IMF programs from 1980 to 2015, we initially demonstrate that the prevalence of market-liberalizing structural reforms increases the likelihood of program interruptions. We then show that program interruptions undermine investor confidence and increase sovereign borrowing costs. Our study uncovers hitherto neglected relationships between the international institutions of regulatory capitalism, country compliance, and financial market responses.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-09","Reinsberg, Bernhard (University of Glasgow) - ORCID: 0000-0001-7382-413X                                                    Stubbs, Thomas (Royal Holloway--University of London) - ORCID: 0000-0002-2624-9272                                                    Kentikelenis, Alexander (Bocconi University) - ORCID: 0000-0002-1543-4595","Reinsberg, Bernhard","Reinsberg, Bernhard; Stubbs, Thomas; Kentikelenis, Alexander, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Compliance, defiance, and the dependency trap: International Monetary Fund program interruptions and their impact on capital markets"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BP81RY, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:3qO3MqqjL92GE/3j9fXboA== [fileUNF]","c(""R&G-replication-embi.tab"", ""R&G-replication-embi.tab"", ""R&G-replication-embi.tab"", ""R&G-replication-embi.tab"")","c(0, 1, 0, NA)","c(15, 88, NA, NA)","c(18316, 763, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"387",387,"Spinning in the rain: interactions between spider web morphology and microhabitat use","AbstractAlthough the effects of abiotic factors on species distributions and habitat selection have been widely investigated, studies have rarely succeeded at identifying the factors behind selection at the microhabitat level. Spider webs are extended phenotypes expected to be subject to fitness trade-offs. We tested the hypothesis that spiders with three-dimensional webs (tangle and sheet-and-tangle), which require more material to be built than two-dimensional orbicular webs, occupy microhabitats where they are better protected from strong rains. We show that tangle and sheet-and-tangle webs were indeed significantly more likely to be under immediate cover than expected by chance and than orb webs. Tangle webs occurred closest to the cover and were largely protected, whereas sheet-and-tangle webs, likely due to their larger size and mostly horizontal position, tended to be more exposed.  Sheet-and-tangle webs, however, occurred more often against tree trunks, where we show rain to be less intense. We further show that the proportion of 3D webs under immediate cover increased with annual precipitation along a dry to wet gradient in western Ecuador, an effect absent for 2D webs. The latter finding suggests that, in addition to using leaves for structural support, spiders with 3D webs seek microhabitat locations to shelter themselves from strong rains. Our findings illustrate how microhabitat selection may allow organisms to cope with abiotic factors at broader geographical scales, thus influencing organismal fitness and community structure.

"388",388,"Beyond leaf habit: generalities in plant function across 97 tropical dry forest tree species","Abstract  Leaf habit has been hypothesized to define a linkage between the slow-fast plant economic spectrum and the drought resistance-avoidance trade-off in tropical forests (‘slow-safe versus fast-risky’). However, variation in hydraulic traits as a function of leaf habit has rarely been explored for a large number of species. We sampled leaf and branch functional traits of 97 tropical dry forest tree species from four sites to investigate whether patterns of trait variation varied consistently in relation to leaf habit along the ‘slow-safe versus fast-risky’ tradeoff. Leaf habit explained from 0 to 43.69 % of individual trait variation. We found that evergreen and semi-deciduous species differed in their location along the multivariate trait ordination when compared to deciduous species. While deciduous species showed consistent trait values, evergreen species trait values varied as a function of the site. Last, trait values varied in relation to the proportion of deciduous species in the plant community. We found that leaf habit describes the strategies that define drought avoidance and plant economics in tropical trees. However, leaf habit alone does not explain patterns of trait variation, which suggests that quantifying site-specific or species-specific uncertainty in trait variation as the way forward.   (2021-07-06)","Other",NA,"2021-07-06","Vargas G., German (University of Minnesota) - ORCID: 0000-0003-1738-0014                                                    Brodribb, Tim J.

"392",392,"Replication Data for: Political Opportunism and Transaction Costs in Contractual Choice of Public–Private Partnerships","The New Public Management (NPM) has achieved many successes in public service delivery, but practitioners frequently observed failures in developing and transitional economies. For instance, China’s public–private partnerships (PPP) since 2014 have failed to transfer risks to the private sector, to involve private skills and expertise, and to reduce local government’s debt. This article claims that PPP failures in China are associated with the contractual type of non-concessions and the contractual choice is influenced by both political opportunism and transaction costs. Utilizing data of PPP projects in China during 2014-2016, we find that more opportunistic bureaucrats seek to increase projects of non-concessions, but transaction costs caused by product complexities hinder governments' reliance on non-concessions. This research extends the core analysis of PPPs in the literature from transaction costs to political opportunism, which widely exists in developing and transitional economies. Thus, our findings partially explain the failure of their NPM practices.

"393",393,"Replication Data for: Civil Conflict and Agenda-Setting Speed in the United Nations Security Council","The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) can respond to a civil conflict only if that conflict first enters the Council's agenda. Some conflicts reach the Council's agenda within days after they start, others after years (or even decades), and some never make it. So far, only a few studies have looked at the crucial UNSC agenda-setting stage, and none have examined agenda-setting speed. To fill this important gap, we develop and test a novel theoretical framework that combines insights from realist and constructivist theory with lessons from institutionalist theory and bargaining theory. Applying survival analysis to an original dataset, we show that the parochial interests of the permanent members (P-5) matter, but they do not determine the Council's agenda-setting speed. Rather, P-5 interests are constrained by normative considerations and concerns for the Council's organizational mission arising from the severity of a conflict (in terms of spillover effects and civilian casualties); by the interests of the widely ignored elected members (E-10); and by the degree of preference heterogeneity among both the P-5 and the E-10. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how the United Nations (UN) works, and they have implications for the UN's legitimacy.

We examine a specific channel through which incumbents can seek to prevent the emergence of a strong opposition that might threaten them in future elections. We present a formal model demonstrating that incumbents can strategically induce opposition fragmentation by appointing some opposition members to ministerial cabinet positions. Opposition politicians who have the opportunity to secure a cabinet position in an incumbent’s government tend to compete for office independently rather than coalescing into broad-based parties or electoral alliances. The model shows that weaker incumbents are more likely to rely on this cooptation strategy. Using original data on presidential elections across African countries in 1990-2016, we show that past cooptation of opposition politicians is associated with a more fragmented opposition field in subsequent elections.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-06-08","Arriola, Leonardo (University of California, Berkeley)                                                    DeVaro, Jed (California State University, East Bay)                                                    Meng, Anne (University of Virginia)","Meng, Anne","Arriola, Leonardo; DeVaro, Jed; Meng, Anne, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Democratic Subversion: Elite Cooptation and Opposition Fragmentation."", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/R8TUOQ, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:Nk/xhGPVreurGI55KFcKrQ== [fileUNF]","c(""demo_subv_adm_code.do"", ""demo_subv_adm_code.do"", ""demo_subv_adm_code.do"", ""demo_subv_adm_code.do"")","c(1, 1, 3, NA)","c(50, NA, NA, NA)","c(135, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

We test the electoral accountability of British legislators for their stance on Brexit. We find that there is very limited issue accountability. Individuals who disagreed with their representative's stance on Brexit were three percentage points less likely to vote for them. The aggregate consequences of these individual effects are limited. A one-standard deviation increase in the proportion of constituents agreeing with their incumbent's Brexit stance is associated with an increase of 0.56 percentage points in incumbent vote share. These effects are ~1.5 times larger when the main challenger has a different Brexit stance to the incumbent. A follow-up survey of Members of Parliament (MPs) shows that MPs' estimates of the effects of congruence are similar in magnitude.

"408",408,"Replication data for: Where does the Coronavirus come from? On the mechanisms underlying the endorsement of conspiracy theories on the origin of SARS-CoV-2","While official science has given its answer to the question on the origin of the Coronavirus (animal to human transmission), alternative theories on human creation of the virus – purposely or inadvertently – have flourished. Those alternative theories can be easily located among the family of conspiracy theories, as they always assume some secretive activity of some groups acting on their self-interest and against the good of the many. The article assesses the prevalence of these beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, studies its development during the pandemic, and investigates its potential determinants. In particular, it analyses the relationship between beliefs in alternative theories on the origin of the virus and political orientation, by arguing that the association cannot be attributed to (politically) motivated reasoning, as the issue has not been highly politicized in the Italian context. Alternatively, the article suggests that the main factor driving beliefs in alternative accounts on the origins of the virus is institutional trust. Political orientation moderates its effects, depending on specific conditions (e.g. cue taking, position of the supported party either in government or opposition), and eventually reinforcing scepticism towards epistemic authorities for those with low trust in institutions. Data come from the ResPOnsE COVID-19 survey, carried out with daily samples from April to July 2020 (N > 15.000) to monitor the development of the Italian public opinion during the Coronavirus pandemic.","Social Sciences","COVID-19, Public opinion, Italy, Conspiracy theory, Institutional trust, Motivated reasoning, Partisanship","2021-04-12","Vezzoni, Cristiano (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0002-3344-5140                                                    Dotti Sani, Giulia (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0001-8616-3078                                                    Chiesi, Antonio Maria (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0002-6178-3761                                                    Ladini, Riccardo (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0003-2900-3814                                                    Biolcati, Ferruccio (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0001-6514-2526                                                    Guglielmi, Simona (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0002-8751-8472                                                    Maggini, Nicola (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0002-6844-1641                                                    Maraffi, Marco (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0002-1955-7429                                                    Molteni, Francesco (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0002-5738-6464                                                    Pedrazzani, Andrea (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0003-1262-2686                                                    Segatti, Paolo (University of Milan ""La Statale"") - ORCID: 0000-0003-1505-2519","Vezzoni, Cristiano","Vezzoni, Cristiano; Dotti Sani, Giulia; Chiesi, Antonio Maria; Ladini, Riccardo; Biolcati, Ferruccio; Guglielmi, Simona; Maggini, Nicola; Maraffi, Marco; Molteni, Francesco; Pedrazzani, Andrea; Segatti, Paolo, 2021, ""Replication data for: Where does the Coronavirus come from?

The COVID Border Accountability Project (COBAP) provides a systematized dataset of >1000 policies, reflecting a timeline of new country-level restrictions on movement across international borders during the 2020 year. Using a 20-question survey, trained research assistants (RAs) sourced and documented for each new border policy: start and end dates, whether the closure constitutes a ""complete closure"" or ""partial closure"", which exceptions are made, which countries are banned, and which borders are closed, among other variables. In addition, the full text of each policy was included in the database. We maintain and update the data each Monday at 12PM EST. For public use, we visualize the data in an interactive map tool visualization: covidborderaccountability.org.

Insights from New Delhi’s Odd-Even Rule against Air Pollution","Policy processes are affected by how policy makers assess public support for a policy. But is public support for a given policy itself affected by characteristics of the policy process, such as cooperation or confrontation among policy actors? Specifically, if different branches of government hold conflicting positions on a given policy, do clashes affect public support for the policy? To address this question, we exploit an unexpected clash amongst the executive and judiciary in New Delhi, between survey waves, over exemptions for women in the context of the odd-even rule, a policy-intervention to reduce air pollution from transportation. We find that public support for the contested policy was not undermined by the executive-judiciary clash. However, the clash polarized public opinion by gender, based upon the policy exemptions. Our findings shed new light on the broader question of how conflicts among different parts of government influence mass public policy preferences.","Social Sciences","air pollution, regulation, policy feedback, public opinion","2021-07-05","Beiser-McGrath, Liam F.

Thus, a conflict would arise when an actor, group or social movement publicly expresses a collective malaise through demands and pressure measures against some public or private instance. This definition is conceptually close to the COES Theoretical Agenda and has been adapted for the purposes of the work to be done. The methodology of the Observatory's work consists of a systematic review of various media and the structuring of this information based on unique events and a series of relevant variables to characterize them. To avoid the biases inherent in media analysis, a wide selection has been selected. A variety of press media, cross-checking between encoders, a group of relevant variables has been specified and the unit of analysis has been clearly defined.

Within interactions, such as debates, deliberations, and discussions, actors can set the agenda by shifting others' attention to their preferred topics. In this article, I use a topic model that locates where topic shifts occur within an interaction in order to measure the relative agenda-setting power of actors (Nguyen et al. 2014). Validation exercises show that the model accurately identifies topic shifts and infers coherent topics. Three empirical applications also validate the agenda-setting measure within different political settings: US presidential debates, in-person deliberations, and online discussions. These applications show that successfully setting the agenda can shape an interaction's outcomes, demonstrating the importance of continued research on this form of agenda setting.

The standard repression or concession logic presumes that the state is strong enough to punish or co-opt dissent effectively. Instead, we argue that the state may disengage when it is weak. We show that colonial governments in French West Africa reduced public investments in districts where chiefs engaged in largely nonviolent disobedience. However, we also show that chieftain disobedience reduced government taxes and fees on Africans, rather than increased them as punishment. Because the state was too weak to punish with higher taxation or to concede by increasing investments, the state disengaged in hard-to-rule districts. Our findings show that chieftain resistance helps explain why subnational development was so unequal during colonialism. Low-level and nonviolent resistance, often overlooked in the conflict literature, also affect state–society relations and state formation.

"444",444,"Replication Data for: When Technocratic Appointments Signal Credibility","How do prime ministers manage investors' expectations during financial crises? We take a novel approach to this question by investigating ministerial appointments. When prime ministers appoint technocrats, defined as non-partisan experts, they forgo political benefits and can credibly signal their willingness to pay down their debt obligations. This reduces bond yields, but only at times when the market is sensitive to expected repayments---i.e., during crises. To examine the theory, we develop an event study analysis that employs new data on the background of finance ministers in 21 Western and Eastern European democracies. We find that investors reward technocratic appointments by reducing a country's borrowing costs. Consistent with the theory, technocratic appointments under crises predict lower bond yields. Our findings contribute to the literature on the interplay of financial markets and domestic politics.

"447",447,"Optimization and validation of a cost-effective protocol for biosurveillance of invasive alien species","Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has revolutionized biodiversity monitoring and invasive pest biosurveillance programs. The introduction of insect pests considered invasive alien species (IAS) into a non-native range poses a threat to native plant health. The early detection of IAS can allow for prompt actions by regulating authorities, thereby mitigating their impacts. In the present study, we optimized and validated a fast and cost-effective eDNA metabarcoding protocol for biosurveillance of IAS and characterization of insect and microorganism diversity. Forty-eight traps were placed, following the CFIA’s annual forest insect trapping survey, at four locations in southern Ontario that are high risk for forest IAS. We collected insects and eDNA samples using Lindgren funnel traps that contained a saturated salt (NaCl) solution in the collection jar. Using cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as a molecular marker, a modified Illumina protocol effectively identified 2,535 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). BINs were distributed among 57 Orders and 304 Families, with the vast majority being arthropods. Two IAS (Agrilus planipennis and Lymantria dispar) are regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as plant health pests, are known to occur in the study area, and were identified through eDNA in collected traps. Similarly, using 16S ribosomal RNA and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), five bacterial and three fungal genera, which contain species of regulatory concern across several Canadian jurisdictions, were recovered from all sampling locations. Our study results reaffirm the effectiveness and importance of integrating eDNA metabarcoding as part of identification protocols in biosurveillance programs.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","biomonitoring, biosurveillance, COI, cytochrome c oxidase I, eDNA metabarcoding, invasive alien species, ITS, internal transcribed spacer, salt trap solution, 16S","2020-07-30","Milián-García, Yoamel (Department of Integrative Biology.

An eDNA surveillance approach maintains specimens for secondary morphological identification useful for regulatory applications. This study identified Culicoides species using eDNA metabarcoding and compared these results to morphological identifications of trapped specimens. Insects were collected using ultra-violet (UV) lighted fan traps containing a saturated salt (NaCl) solution from two locations in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. There were forty-two Culicoides specimens collected in total. Molecular identification detected four species, C. biguttatus, C. stellifer, C. obsoletus, and C. mulrennani. Using morphological identification, two out of these four taxonomic ranks were confirmed at the species level (C. biguttatus and C. stellifer), one was confirmed at the subgenus level (Avaritia [C. obsoletus]). No molecular detection of Culicoides species occurred in traps with an abundance of less than three individuals per taxon. The inconsistency in identifying Culicoides specimens to species punctuates the need for curated DNA reference libraries for Culicoides. In conclusion, the saturated salt (NaCl) solution preserved the Culicoides' morphological characters and the eDNA.","Agricultural Sciences; Earth and Environmental Sciences","eDNA metabarcoding, Culicoides, biosurveillance, morphology, molecular identification","2021-03-29","Milián-García, Yoamel (Department of Integrative Biology.

"454",454,"Replication Data for: Gender gap in political science: An analysis of the scientific publications and career paths of Italian political scientists.","This paper assesses whether the presence of a gender gap in Political Science, identified in the international literature, is present also in the context of Italian Political Science. Literature has mostly centred on the comparison of female publication in international journals with the academic workforce in United States, but this raises an issue of data comparability. As an alternative strategy to avoid comparability biases, this work focuses on the analysis of a single national case: Italy. The paper evaluates to what extent the ""glass ceiling"" effect persists for political scientists who intend to publish their contributions. Analysing data on articles published between 2015 and 2020 by the three major Italian journals of Political Science, this contribution shows that: i) the proportion of published articles written by female authors is lower than that of male authors; ii) the hypothesis that the lower female production depends on a lower female presence in the field of Political Science is refuted; iii) there is a scarce collaboration between men and women; iv) there is a correlation between the presence of female editors in scientific journals and the share of female articles; and v) gender differences are reflected in women’s academic career progression.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-03","Cellini, Marco (Institute for Research on Population and Social Policies, Italian National Research Council (IRPPS-CNR)) - ORCID: 0000-0002-7580-2804","Cellini, Marco","Cellini, Marco, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Gender gap in political science: An analysis of the scientific publications and career paths of Italian political scientists."", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YEFLJZ, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:eCUPIKESpq/Ac9GHCkmFvA== [fileUNF]","c(""DB_Gender gap in political science An analysis of the scien.tab"", ""DB_Gender gap in political science An analysis of the scien.tab"")","c(19, NA)","c(7, NA)","c(5, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

We posit that while the frequency of social conflict in developing agrarian states can increase during drought, democratic competition reduces conflict and can facilitate cooperation, reversing this effect. This hypothesis is tested on a sample of all districts in India over a period from 2001–2014. The de- pendent variable captures the number of crimes perpetrated against scheduled castes – so-called “untouchables”– and scheduled tribes – India’s indigenous groups – during a given district-year. When the effect of drought is moderated using a local electoral competition index, findings show that although droughts increase the frequency of social conflicts where political institutions are weak, they reduce it where political institutions are strong. The results are robust to alternative operationalization choices. Our findings thus have relevance both to scholars of the climate-conflict nexus and to policymakers working to address climate change’s effects.","Social Sciences; Agricultural Sciences",NA,"2021-06-22","Sarbahi, Anoop and Koren, Ore (Indiana University)","Koren, Ore","Sarbahi, Anoop and Koren, Ore, 2021, ""The Moderating Effect of Democracy on Climate-Induced Social Conflict: Evidence from Indian Districts"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/R3QIWX, Harvard Dataverse, V2, UNF:6:cpORTCMTsbfA9WrMHkrs1g== [fileUNF]","c(""CasteConflict_Script_6_21.R"", ""CasteConflict_Script_6_21.R"", ""CasteConflict_Script_6_21.R"", ""CasteConflict_Script_6_21.R"")","c(2, 3, 3, NA)","c(37, NA, NA, NA)","c(8260, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

However, enacting successful reforms curtailing racially biased policing requires understanding whether bias is widespread, likely tied to systemic sources, or the work of a few racist officers. This study elaborates on these perspectives by drawing on theories of systemic and individual bias that may arise when bureaucrats have ample discretion. Using millions of traffic stops, I construct two measures to evaluate whether disparities are widespread — as indicated by the first perspective — or confined to a few officers — as suggested by the second. This study finds widespread racial disparities in who is searched following a traffic stop across officers and agencies and that banning consent searches would alter policing patterns more than eliminating outlier officers.","Social Sciences","Race; Policing; Computational Methods; Traffic Stops","2021-07-06","Shoub, Kelsey (University of South Carolina)","Shoub, Kelsey","Shoub, Kelsey, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Comparing Systemic and Individual Sources of Racially Disparate Traffic Stop Outcomes"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UHLKUO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:qCiqVZ/v+ivusxOZjCCc3Q== [fileUNF]","c(""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"", ""AgencyAnalysis_CT.R"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

This letter argues that practices around research ethics in violent contexts should be reported more transparently in research outputs, and should be seen as a subset of research methods. We offer practical suggestions and empirical evidence from both within and outside of political science around risk assessments, mitigating the risk of distress and negative psychological outcomes, informed consent, and monitoring the incidence of potential harms.

"475",475,"Dependence of alpha-particle-driven Alfven eigenmode linear stability on device magnetic field strength and consequences for next-generation tokamaks","Recently-proposed tokamak concepts use magnetic fields up to 12 T, far higher than in conven- tional devices, to reduce size and cost. Theoretical and computational study of trends in plasma behavior with increasing field strength is critical to such proposed devices. This paper considers trends in Alfven eigenmode (AE) stability. Energetic particles, including alphas from D-T fusion, can destabilize AEs, possibly causing loss of alpha heat and damage to the device. AEs are sensitive to device magnetic field via the field dependence of resonances, alpha particle beta, and alpha orbit width. We describe the origin and effect of these dependences analytically and by using recently- developed numerical techniques (Rodrigues et al. 2015 Nucl. Fusion 55 083003). The work suggests high-field machines where fusion-born alphas are sub-Alfvenic or nearly sub-Alfvenic may partially cut off AE resonances, reducing growth rates of AEs and the energy of alphas interacting with them. High-field burning plasma regimes have non-negligible alpha particle beta and AE drive, but faster slowing down time, provided by high electron density, and higher field strength reduces this drive relative to low-field machines with similar power densities. The toroidal mode number of the most unstable modes will tend to be higher in high magnetic field devices. The work suggests that high magnetic field devices have unique, and potentially advantageous, AE instability properties at both low and high densities.","Physics","AE, alpha heat, alpha orbit width, conventional devices, damage, deuterium-tritium fusion, device magnetic field strength, energetic particles, field dependence, fusion-born alphas, high magnetic field devices, high-field burning plasma regimes, high-field machines, higher field strength, low-field machines, magnetic fields, next-generation tokamaks, nonnegligible alpha particle beta, tokamak concepts",NA,"Tolman, E.A.; Loureiro, N.F.; Rodrigues, P.; Hughes, J.W.; Marmar, E.S.",NA,"Tolman, E.A.; Loureiro, N.F.; Rodrigues, P.; Hughes, J.W.; Marmar, E.S., 2021, ""Dependence of alpha-particle-driven Alfven eigenmode linear stability on device magnetic field strength and consequences for next-generation tokamaks"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XRERDT, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:qQswiZARVUwszz0xhQ9bIw== [fileUNF]","c(""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja057_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, NA, NA)","c(14, 94, 94, 53, 39, 44, 355, 362, 395, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

I connect the literature on language and cognition, and then develop a theory of how bottom-up and top-down processing is indicative of how partisans conceptualize problems. I demonstrate how the structure of language is differently informative than the selection of lexical items. It is the how, not the what, that creates influential messaging and reveals how people conceptualize political problems. I examine four corpora across several linguistic dimensions.

"493",493,"Replication Data for: The Impact of the U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System on Redistricting and Voting Rights Analysis","The U.S. Census Bureau plans to protect the privacy of 2020 Census respondents through its Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), which attempts to achieve differential privacy guarantees by adding noise to the Census microdata. We empirically investigate the impact of DAS on redistricting and voting rights analysis under a likely scenario in which practitioners— map drawers and analysts alike—treat the DAS-protected data “as-is” without accounting for the DAS mechanism. We apply redistricting simulation and analysis methods to the DAS-protected 2010 Census data and compare the results with those obtained based on the original Census data. Our analysis of federal, state, and local redistricting cases shows that the most recently released levels of noise would have profound effects on redistricting in the United States. First, we find that DAS has a tendency to transfer population across geographies in ways that artificially reduce racial and partisan heterogeneity. In some cases, DAS-protected data can yield the number of majority-minority districts that is different from the one obtained under the original census data. These differences can lead to unpredictable changes in the analysis of partisan and racial gerrymanders. Second, the injected noise makes it impossible to accurately comply with the One Person, One Vote principle as currently interpreted and implemented. Finally, we find that the DAS does not degrade the overall predictive accuracy of an individual’s race based on the voter files and Census data. Yet, the individual-level race predictions based on the DAS data differ significantly from those based on the original census data, potentially affecting the analysis of redistricting cases especially for local offices. We conclude with implications of our findings for future redistricting and voting rights analysis under the privacy-protected Census data.","Law; Social Sciences","Census, Redistricting, BISG, Differential Privacy, TopDown algorithm, One Person One Vote","2021-07-05","Kenny, Christopher T.

"510",510,"Replication Data for: Leaders and Default","Sovereign default is a political decision. While previous research on sovereign credit markets focuses on economic causes, domestic constraints, or international reputation to explain why states default, we focus on leaders. We argue that leaders who come to power under irregular circumstances are more likely to default. Irregular leaders are themselves more vulnerable to turnover and therefore prioritize the short-term benefits of default rather than the long-term benefits of repayment. In addition, irregular regime transitions offer new leaders a way to obfuscate responsibility, thus limiting the reputational costs of default. Our analysis of sovereign defaults and leadership transitions from 1875 to 2015 support our claims. Across various model specifications, we find that irregular leadership change increases the odds of default onset by over 300 percent.

"511",511,"Replication Data for: Can Warm Behavior Mitigate the Negative Effect of Unfavorable Governmental Decisions on Citizens' Trust?","For decades, scholars have discussed how to build greater citizen trust in government. I hypothesize that to increase trust in government, we should consider whether decisions made in bureaucrat-citizen encounters (e.g., applications for welfare benefits) are favorable to citizens. Building on insights from social psychology, I argue that in cases where citizens are presented with unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejection of applications), public employees can mitigate the negative impact on trust in government by appearing warm and friendly in the decision-making process. The argument is tested in a large-scale randomized survey experiment on a representative sample of Danish citizens, where I manipulate decision favorability and warmth. The findings reveal that outcome favorability and warmth strongly influence citizens' trust in government.

It's primary marketing factor nonetheless is its ability to eliminate smoke from the air, which can result in significant health and wellness complications later on. It is understood that cigarette smoking is really dangerous for your health and wellness due to the fact that it not only causes extreme respiratory problems like asthma but it additionally causes a variety of other health difficulties. It is as a result important that you get rid of this practice immediately.When you check out Olansi Air Cleanser site https://www.olansikr.com/air-purifiers.html, you will certainly get to see a number of benefits of using this purifier. Among these is its lengthy life span. It has actually been developed to make sure that it will continue working for as long as you require it to. This is fairly fantastic thinking about the fact that most other producers will certainly shut down their items after a few years. You can be sure that this maker is refraining this simply on an impulse.One more good idea about this item is the reality that you do not have to deal with filters. Since they get obstructed with microorganisms and dust fragments, various other air purifying as well as filtering system systems require you to change your filter regularly. Other business utilize fragment filter that are hard to clean. The Olansi Air Purifiers has a filter that are made from materials that are immune to any type of sort of germs, microorganisms or air-borne particles.Some of the things that this maker of air purifiers worldwide have in common with other brands is making use of sophisticated modern technology. The firm uses the innovation called the favorable ion air cleanser. This has what is referred to as unfavorable ion innovation. What are adverse ions? Well, they are charged particles that are found in celestial spaces. They are accountable for eliminating any damaging bacteria that are in the air such as bacteria and germs.The producer of this air purifier is trying to relocate the science of favorable ions into the realm of the residence. Due to the fact that they understand that we need a lot more excellent germs in our indoor air, they established this system. The manufacturer knows that people are allergic to the impacts of negative ions. The triggered carbon in the room of this cleanser allows it to record the pollutants before they go into the indoor air. This brand name of cleansers also has included additional technology that permits them to capture any germs airborne also.The way that the air cleansers job is based on the reality that some bacteria and also infections can reduce the effects of the positive ions in the air. To stop this, the maker of the Olansi brand created an unique filter that records the viruses before they get in the air. This filter is also made use of in various other brands as well, not simply the Olansi. It is very important that all manufacturers are working together on study to stop unfavorable ions from reducing the effects of the good microorganisms in the air.Additionally, the air purifiers mini industrial moulding maker provider in Pittsburgh also provides ozone and also UV filters. These filters aid to clean the air inside the spaces of your residence without needing to make use of any kind of chemicals. All of these products are designed to cleanse your air while minimizing the amount of ozone or UV that is in the air. Both of these pollutants can cause damage to your lungs. ozone is taken into consideration to be a cancer cells triggering agent. Consequently, it is a good idea to take all of these pollutants out of your life as well as living environment.There are several advantages to making use of a plastic producer as well as cleanser.

"547",547,"Globally, plant-soil feedbacks are weak predictors of plant abundance","AbstractPlant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have been shown to strongly affect plant performance under controlled conditions, and PSFs are thought to have far reaching consequences for plant population dynamics and the structuring of plant communities. However, thus far the relationship between PSF and plant species abundance in the field is not consistent. Here, we synthesize PSF experiments from tropical forests to semiarid grasslands, and test for a positive relationship between plant abundance in the field and PSFs estimated from controlled bioassays. We meta-analyzed results from 22 PSF experiments and found an overall positive correlation (0.12 ≤ ▁(r ̅ ) ≤ 0.32) between plant abundance in the field and PSFs across plant functional types (herbaceous and woody plants) but also variation by plant functional type. Thus, our analysis provides quantitative support that plant abundance has a general albeit weak positive relationship with PSFs across ecosystems. Overall, our results suggest that harmful soil biota tend to accumulate around and disproportionately impact species that are rare. However, data for the herbaceous species, which are most common in the literature, had no significant abundance-PSFs relationship. Therefore, we conclude that further work is needed within and across biomes, succession stages and plant types, both under controlled and field conditions, while separating PSF effects from other drivers (e.g. herbivory, competition, disturbance) of plant abundance to tease apart the role of soil biota in causing patterns of plant rarity versus commonness.

"557",557,"Queen-worker conflict can drive the evolution of social  polymorphism and split sex ratios in facultatively eusocial life-cycles","AbstractHamilton’s idea that haplodiploidy favors the evolution of altruism – the haplodiploidy hypothesis -- relies on the relatedness asymmetry between the sexes, caused by the sex-specific ploidies. Theoretical work on the consequences of relatedness asymmetries has significantly improved our understanding of sex-allocation and intra-colony conflicts, but the importance of haplodiploidy for the evolution of altruism came to be seen as minor. However, recently it was shown that haplodiploidy can strongly favor the evolution of eusociality, provided additional “preadaptations” are also present, such as the production of multiple broods per season and maternal ability to bias offspring sex ratios. These results were obtained assuming no influence of workers on the sex ratio, even though worker control of the sex ratio is known to occur. Here we model the evolution of sex-specific fratricide as a mechanism of worker control over the sex ratio. We show that fratricide can facilitate the initial evolution of helping. However, fratricide can also hamper the evolution of unconditional help. Instead, social polymorphism evolves, a mixture of helping and dispersing offspring. Finally, we show that the co-evolution of sex-allocation strategies of workers (fratricide) and queens leads to a split production of the sexes, with some colonies specializing in males and others in females. Thus, the model predicts that fratricide spawns a diversity of co-existing life cycles that strongly vary in degree of sociality and sex ratios.

The code both for generating the data and for figure of the published article can be found in here: DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3361665 Files names starting with the identifier ""evol"" correspond to the evolutionary trajectories, while files named starting with ""dist"" correspond to phenotypic distributions at the end of the evolutionary process. After the identifier, file names contain 3 numbers, each one followed by the information of the simulation they communicate. The first number gives the seed used in the random number generator for that particular simulation, it is followed by the word ""seed"". The second number provides the value used in parameter phi multiplied by 10, for convenience, and it is followed by the word ""phi"". Finally, the last number gives the value used in parameter b multiplied by 10, and it is followed by the letter b.  The files of evolutionary trajectories contain data on the central tendency and spread of the 5 phenotypic trait along the evolutionary process. The 16 columns in the files correspond to: generation, mean for z1, mean for z3, mean for z5, mean for h, mean for omega, standard deviation for z1, standard deviation for z3, standard deviation for z5, standard deviation for h, standard deviation for omega, first quartile for z1, first quartile for z3, first quartile for z5,  first quartile for h,  first quartile for omega,  third quartile for z1,  third quartile for z3,  third quartile for z5,  third quartile for h,  third quartile for omega.  The files with the phenotypic distribution at the end of the evolutionary process contain values for the traits of different individuals in the population.

"563",563,"Occupation, Earnings and Expenditure of the Daily Wage-based and Salaried Workforce in Farm and Nonfarm Sectors: Data from Bangladesh","At present nearly half of the world’s population is under some form of government restriction to curb the spread of COVID-19, an extremely contagious disease. In Bangladesh, in the wake of five deaths and 48 infections from COVID-19, between March 24 and May 30, 2020 the government imposed a nationwide lockdown. While this lockdown restricted the spread of COVID-19, in the absence of effective support, it can generate severe food and nutrition insecurity for daily wage-based workers. Of the 61 million employed labor force in Bangladesh, nearly 35% of them are paid on a daily basis. This study examines the food security and welfare impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown on daily wage workers both in the farm and nonfarm sectors in Bangladesh. Using information from more than 50,000 respondents complied from 2016-17 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in Bangladesh, this study estimates daily wage rates as Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 272.2 in the farm sector and BDT 361.5 in the nonfarm sector. Using the estimated daily wages earnings, this study estimates that a one-day complete lockdown generates a US$64.2 million equivalent economic loss only considering the wage loss of the daily wage workers. After estimating the daily per capita food expenditure separately for farm and nonfarm households, this study estimates a minimum compensation package for the daily wage-based farm and nonfarm households around US $ 1 per day per household to ensure minimum food security for the daily wage-based worker households.

Using nationally representative data from Nigeria, this paper demonstrates that motherhood has no statistically significant impact on women's self-employment probabilities in a context where self-employment is predominantly informal, and marriage creates extended family networks. Instead, after accounting for selection bias and the endogeneity of fertility and education decisions jointly, we find that lack of education drives up women's self-employment probabilities in such a context. These findings are robust to alternative specifications.

Measuring Degrees of Populism in Party Manifestos Using Supervised Machine Learning""","One of the main challenges in comparative studies on populism concerns its temporal and spatial measurements within and between a large number of parties and countries. Textual analysis has proved useful for these purposes, and automated methods can further improve research in this direction. Here we propose a method to derive a score of parties’ levels of populism using supervised machine learning to perform textual analysis on national manifestos. We illustrate the advantages of our approach, which allows for measuring populism for a vast number of parties and countries without resource-intensive human-coding processes and provides accurate, updated information of temporal and spatial comparisons of populism. Furthermore, our method allows for obtaining a continuous score of populism, which ensures more fine-grained analyses of the party landscape while reducing the risk of arbitrary classifications. To illustrate the potential contribution of this score, we use it as a proxy for parties’ levels of populism, analysing average trends in six European countries from the early 2000s for nearly two decades.

Why do some countries pay more diplomatic visits while other countries host more foreign visits? How to explain the formation and evolution of the global diplomatic visit network? Existing research focuses on factors at the dyadic- and country- levels between the visiting country and the host country while theoretically ignoring the potential influence from third parties and the structures of the diplomatic networks. Methodologically, they also ignore the interdependence among observations that could result in biased model estimation. Moreover, they are constrained by the lack of data covering diplomatic visits around the world. Leveraging the social network analysis, this article theorizes the global bilateral diplomatic visits as the formation of diplomatic visit networks, and integrates factors at the national, dyadic, and network structure levels into a unified theoretical framework. Utilizing the Global Event, Language, and Intonation Database (GDELT) project, it builds a global diplomatic visit data set (1979-2020), which is then used to test the hypotheses derived from the theoretical framework. The results show that, in addition to country- and dyadic-level factors, network effects such as stochastic equivalence, preferential attachment, reciprocity, and homophily, of the diplomatic visit network itself have also driven the evolution of the global diplomatic visit network in the past 40 years. Consequently, this article provides a new framework and new approach for the systematic understanding of the evolution of global diplomatic networks. It also produces a new global bilateral diplomatic exchange data set based on the big data approach, which has important implications for the studies of foreign policy and international politics in the age of big data.

This reinforcement, or ""safety-in-numbers,"" effect arises because speaking in authoritarian assemblies is an intrinsically dangerous task, and delegates are reluctant to do so without confidence in the information they would present. This logic contrasts sharply with the notion of performative responsiveness occurring in more democratic parliaments.

"613",613,"Replication Data for: A Typology of Substitution: Weather, Armed Conflict, and Maritime Piracy","Abstract: How do rebels choose among available tactics during civil war? How do they substitute one tactic for another? Although previous studies address these questions, they narrowly focus on the presence or absence of substitution. Differentiating the varieties of substitution, however, is critical. How rebels respond to their tactical environment—including weather conditions—depends on the type of substitution.

The analysis of daily panel data in 31 coastal conflict countries indicates that rebels substitute violent ground activities for maritime piracy but not vice versa.

Although extensive research has examined the question of who votes, without knowing who is missing from the voter register, our understanding of the determinants of political participation is limited. Studying voter registration in lower income settings is particularly challenging due to data constraints. We link the official voter register with a complete social network census of 16 villages to analyze the correlates of voter registration in rural Uganda, examining the role of individual-level attributes and social ties. We find evidence that social ties are important for explaining registration status within and across households. Village leaders – and through them, household heads – play an important role in explaining the registration status of others in the village, suggesting a diffuse process of social influence. Socioeconomic factors such as income and education do not explain registration in this setting. Together these findings suggest an alternate theory of participation is required.

The aircraft's fuel consumption per passenger and 100 flown kilometers decreases rapidly with range, until a near constant level is reached around the aircraft’s average range. At longer range, where payload reduction becomes necessary, fuel consumption increases significantly. Numerical results are visualized, explained, and discussed. With regard to today’s increasing number of long-haul flights, the results are investigated in terms of efficiency and viability. The environmental impact of burning fuel is not considered in this report. The presented method allows calculating aircraft type specific fuel consumption based on publicly available information. In this way, the fuel consumption of every aircraft can be investigated and can be discussed openly.

"624",624,"Genesis of a free online bibliographic analysis program (Bibliovid) and its influence on clinical practices of healthcare professionals in the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2: a multicentric cross-sectional survey-based study","Problem — Literature search can be very time and energy-consuming for practitioners, particularly in times of pandemic. Future medical practice should consist of acting collectively with web-based tools. Intervention — In Grenoble, France, volunteer medical residents and public health doctors decided to design an online bibliographic program to select, analyze and summarize, in French, the most relevant scientific articles in order to help clinicians. The website was updated daily with a subsequent English translation of the analyzes. The project took place between March 26th and July 31st, 2020 and ending after the first wave of the pandemic. Context — In December 2019, an emerging infectious disease called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in Wuhan, China before spreading worldwide and leading to the World Health Organization’s declaration of a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30th, 2020. A wave of misinformation quickly reached the scientific world and beyond, due to an exponential increase in publications of varying qualities, making it difficult for evidence-based decisions. Impact — We conducted a cross-sectional observational survey-based study on healthcare professionals taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients during the first wave of the pandemic using an online bibliographic analysis program (Bibliovid) to assess the impact of the level of use of this tool on drafting and updating of standardized guidelines, changes in department and individual practices, their standardization, and time saved by clinicians as well as the impact on their literature search, using a 70-point scoring system, each question being self-reported on a scale from 0 to 10. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the questionnaire based on the scoring system, evaluating its internal consistency, was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.77–0.79). The average total score was significantly higher in the high-use group compared to the low-use group (48.4 ± 12.8 vs 39 ± 12; p<.001) in multivariate analysis. A significant relationship was found between the impact on changes in practices (total score) and the professional’s participation in protocol development (p = 0.009) and department logistics (p = 0.003). Lessons Learned — At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the creation of a free online bibliographic review in French, Bibliovid, proved to be helpful for healthcare professionals. With the prolongation of the pandemic, however, we realized that the sustainability of this tool required long term dedicated financial and human resources. To manage and update the large amounts of publications artificial intelligence may be a helpful tool.

We sampled 16 willow plantations (4.5m X 2.5m) of one or four cultivars from which half was coppiced after three years. For each plot, we measured ten functional traits from aboveground and belowground tissues (LA, SLA, LDMC, RDMC, LNC, RNC, LCC, RCC, SSD, and leaf pH) and six phytoremediation services (Phytoextraction, phytostabilisation, translocation factors, soil decontamination, and bioconcentration factors of total and belowground tissues). To do so, we measured trace elements in plant tissues and soil. We tested the impacts of treatments (willow diversity and coppicing) on the services and traits through linear mixed models and controlled for spatial heterogeneity with soil covariates (OM, texture and initial contamination). We explored the traits-services correlations through a redundancy analysis (RDA).

We hypothesized that participants who perform other- compared with own-race identifications would be less likely to detect when their identification decision is manipulated. To test this hypothesis, Black (n=40) and White African (n=43), as well as Black (n=22) and White European (n=40) participants, were asked to identify Caucasian targets. Participants watched four mock crime films and made several identifications from simultaneous target-present and target-absent lineups. Forty-eight hours later, participants had to justify their identification decisions for the perpetrators. For two of the four identifications participants were confronted with a non-previously identified lineup member. Next to a significant ORE, we found that participants who made other-race identifications were less likely to detect the manipulations (27%) than participants who made own-race identifications (47%). Interracial contact did not affect detection ability. Unexpectedly, rejections that were turned into positive identifications were not more likely to be detected than interchanged identification decisions. The decreased detection rates for other- versus own-race identifications speaks for worse monitoring at retrieval for other-race faces.","Social Sciences","choice blindness, other-race effect, interracial contact, eyewitness identification, manipulation","2021-06-10","Sagana, Anna (Maastricht University) - ORCID: 0000-0003-4776-8431                                                    Sauerland, Melanie (Maastricht University) - ORCID: 0000-0002-7401-1365                                                    Merckelbach, Harald (Maastricht University) - ORCID: 0000-0002-5116-7826","Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience - Maastricht University","Sagana, Anna; Sauerland, Melanie; Merckelbach, Harald, 2021, ""Eyewitnesses’ blindness for changes in one’s own- and other-race lineup identification"", https://doi.org/10.34894/2DLLOV, DataverseNL, V1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Harvard Dataverse"

PROMIS Pediatric Short Forms and the PAQLQ were used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across 4 time points (T1 to T4) over 2 years; the Asthma Control and Communication Instrument was used to measure change of asthma control; Global Rating of Change (GRC) for breathing problems and overall health were used to measure change of health status. Responsiveness was tested by comparing the changes of HRQoL with change of asthma control and health status over time using t-tests, generalized estimating equation, and relative validity approaches. The PROMIS asthma impact scale (p<0.05) and all PAQLQ scales (p’s<0.05) exhibited significant responsiveness when anchored to asthma control and health status. Several PROMIS generic scales (pain, fatigue, and mobility) also indicated adequate responsiveness. The PROMIS asthma impact scale indicated similar responsiveness to the PAQLQ. Due to its brevity and responsiveness, the PROMIS asthma impact scale is useful for clinical practice or research.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",NA,"2021-06-30","Huang, I-Chan (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)","Shen, Shu-En","Huang, I-Chan, 2021, ""PROMIS Pediatric Asthma Study"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MCSRLN, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""PROMIS_PAS_DataArchive_Codebook_Demographics.IH.docx"", ""PROMIS_PAS_DataArchive_Codebook_Demographics.IH.docx"", ""PROMIS_PAS_DataArchive_Codebook_Demographics.IH.docx"", ""PROMIS_PAS_DataArchive_Codebook_Demographics.IH.docx"", ""PROMIS_PAS_DataArchive_Codebook_Demographics.IH.docx"")","c(1, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"652",652,"Replication Data for: Vigilantes and the state: understanding violence through a security assemblages approach","The notion that states pursue a monopoly over the use of force rings increasingly hollow. From vigilantes that patrol the US’s southern border to thugs for hire in China, states are characterized by non-state violent actors. These trends are more pronounced in comparatively lower-capacity states. Employing the concept of “security assemblages,” this article proposes that it is crucial to consider historically-embedded relations among violent actors and institutions in order to understand their role and implications for state authority. This approach offers three insights: first, in low-capacity states, violence is not zero-sum. Rather, it is assembled among diverse actors, which have historically embedded comparative advantages. Therefore, second, state efforts to monopolize violence should be taken as an empirical question rather than an assumption grounding analysis. Third, relationships between violent actors occur in thick institutional environments, meaning that violent actors, including state actors and institutions, often must act under significant constraints. To illustrate these points, the article conducts a mixed-methods nested study of vigilantes in Uganda, finding that vigilantes are more common where other authorities are present, and are more helpful when other authorities are also more helpful. Focusing on dynamics between vigilantes and police, the article pinpoints their historically distinct roles: the police were established as a colonial era institution to suppress political dissent, while vigilantes have long been socially-embedded actors tasked with everyday security provision. Thus, in this case, police and vigilantes are not substitutes; instead they play distinct and complementary roles.","Social Sciences","monopoly on violence, vigilantes, the state, policing, Uganda","2021-04-06","Tapscott, Rebecca - ORCID: 0000-0002-0936-5191","Tapscott, Rebecca","Tapscott, Rebecca, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Vigilantes and the state: understanding violence through a security assemblages approach"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ONU9NB, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:/kKiHkiR6dWish44LDxpJQ== [fileUNF]","c(""ReadMe.rtf"", ""ReadMe.rtf"", ""ReadMe.rtf"", ""ReadMe.rtf"")","c(1, 0, 0, NA)","c(154, NA, NA, NA)","c(1539, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

Yet, the region has consistently higher levels of ethnocentrism than the rest of Europe. Scholars argue that the East’s limited politicization of immigration is due to its status as a region of emigration and the presence of ethnic minority “others”. I argue that this is changing. The politicization of the European refugee crisis by domestic elites has begun to refocus the sociocultural dimension on the immigration issue. Using structural equation models, I compare European Values Study data from 2008 and 2017 across 10 East European EU member states. I find evidence that traditionalist attitudes are more strongly related to anti-immigration attitudes since the crisis, particularly for those who are interested in politics. Further, immigration attitudes are polarizing across the GAL-TAN dimension and by education. Hence, immigration is bolstering a pre-existing, socially structured divide around both nationalist and traditionalist values.

"664",664,"Optimization of tritium breeding ratio in ARC reactor","Affordable Robust Compact reactor is a conceptual design for a Tokamak conceived by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers. The design of this tokamak is under development and update. One of the key parameters for fusion reactor power plants is the tritium breeding ratio (TBR), which has to guarantee the tritium self-sufficiency. The tritium inventory circulating in a fusion power plant must be minimized. In the meantime, to enhance plant’s economics, the amount of tritium generated and stored should be maximized, since it would be used to startup new reactors. Both of the aforementioned trends meet their best in a TBR as high as possible. In this work, ARC tritium breeding ratio is studied and optimized. Taking advantage of Monte Carlo neutron transport codes, several configurations of ARC’s blanket and vacuum vessel have been analyzed in order to find the most effective one for a high TBR. The study takes into account different materials for the structure, such as Inconel718, V-15Cr-5Ti and Eurofer97. Moreover, it scans different width of coolant’s channels and evaluates the effect of lithium-6 enrichment in the blanket looking for the best configuration in terms of TBR.","Physics","affordable, blanket, neutronics, Robust compact (ARC), tokamak, tritium breeding ratio",NA,"Segantin, Stefano; Testoni, Raffaella; Hartwig, Zachary; Whyte, Dennis; Zucchetti, Massimo",NA,"Segantin, Stefano; Testoni, Raffaella; Hartwig, Zachary; Whyte, Dennis; Zucchetti, Massimo, 2021, ""Optimization of tritium breeding ratio in ARC reactor"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LQX39Q, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""20ja056_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""20ja056_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

This study advances our understanding of the consequences of militarization for perceptions of law enforcement: whether visual features shape perceptions of effectiveness, respect for civil liberties, proclivity for corruption, and acceptance of militarization in one’s own neighborhood. Based on a nationally representative, image-based, conjoint experiment conducted in Mexico, we find that military weapons and uniforms enhance perceptions of effectiveness and respect for civil liberties, and that the effect of military uniform becomes greater with increased military presence. We also find that gender shapes perceptions of civil liberties and corruption, but we find no effect for skin color. The findings suggest that a central feature of militarization linked to greater violence—military weapons—is paradoxically a key factor explaining favorable attitudes, and that women can play a crucial role in improving perceptions of law enforcement.","Social Sciences","Militarization, Public perceptions, Conjoint, Mexico","2021-04-11","Flores-Macías, Gustavo (Cornell) - ORCID: 0000-0002-5285-3852                                                    Zarkin, Jessica (Cornell) - ORCID: 0000-0003-1443-2755","Zarkin, Jessica","Flores-Macías, Gustavo; Zarkin, Jessica, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Militarization and Perceptions of Law Enforcement in the Developing World: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment in Mexico"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UMUEOK, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:l6uF4w0/rAcRAjBL+nQr8Q== [fileUNF]","c(""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"", ""1_ReadMe.txt"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(8, 8, 8, 8, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(32, 32, 32, 32, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"667",667,"Electroless Production of Fertilizer (Struvite) and Hydrogen from Synthetic Agricultural Wastewaters","The drive towards sustainable phosphorous (P) recovery from agricultural and municipal wastewater streams has intensified. However, combining P recovery with energy conservation is perhaps one of the greatest challenges of this century. In this study, we report for the first time, the simultaneous electroless production of struvite and di-hydrogen from aqueous ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) solutions in contact with either a pure magnesium (Mg) or a Mg alloy as the anode and 316 stainless steel (SS) as the cathode placed in a bench-scale electrochemical reactor. During the electroless process (i.e., in the absence of external electrical power), the open circuit potential (OCP), the formation of struvite on the anode, and the generation of di-hydrogen at the cathode were monitored. We found that struvite is formed, and that struvite crystal structure/morphology and precipitate film thickness are affected by the concentration of the HnPO4n-3/NH4+ in solution and the composition of the anode. The pure Mg anode produced a porous, 0.6-4.1 µm thick film, while the AZ31 Mg alloy produced a more compact, 1.7-9.9 µm thick struvite film. Kinetic analyses revealed that Mg dissolution to Mg2+ followed mostly a zero-order kinetic rate law for both Mg anode materials and the rate constants (k) depended upon the struvite layer morphology. Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the synthesized struvite was of high quality. The di-hydrogen and Mg2+ in solution were detected by a gas chromatography (GC)-thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and ion chromatography (IC), respectively. Furthermore, we fully demonstrate that the reactor was able to remove ~73% of the HnPO4n-3 present in a natural poultry wastewater as mainly struvite. This study highlights the feasability of simultaneously producing struvite and di-hydrogen from wastewater effluents with no energy input in a green and sustainable approach.","Chemistry",NA,"2021-06-29","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo (University of Arkansas)                                                    Abolhassani, Mojtaba (University of Arkansas)                                                    Perez Bakovic, Sergio (University of Arkansas)                                                    Moore, John (University of Arkansas)                                                    Pollet, Bruno (Norwegian University of Science and Technology)                                                    Greenlee, Lauren (University of Arkansas)","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo; Abolhassani, Mojtaba; Perez Bakovic, Sergio; Moore, John; Pollet, Bruno; Greenlee, Lauren, 2021, ""Electroless Production of Fertilizer (Struvite) and Hydrogen from Synthetic Agricultural Wastewaters"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GQWMRB, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:DyPsZa0CT/RmWqkHMJaeKw== [fileUNF]","c(""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"", ""10002.jpg"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"668",668,"An electrochemical study of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate on Mg and Mg alloy electrodes","In this work, the electrochemistry of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate in aqueous solution on Mg and Mg AZ31 alloy (Al 3 wt%, Zn 1 wt%, balanced Mg) electrodes was studied using electrochemical characterization similar to electro-agglomeration and physical characterization to shed some light on the electrochemical mechanism of struvite formation as phosphate precipitation in waste. It was found that the Mg AZ31 alloy exhibited higher corrosion current densities (jcorr), therefore, higher Mg2+ dissolution rates compared to pure Mg. This finding was confirmed by ion chromatography (IC) analysis, in which the presence of Mg2+ was due to the oxidation of the Mg metal, and the higher Mg2+ concentration for the Mg AZ31 alloy 62.7 ppm vs. 57.5 ppm for pure Mg was in good agreement with the higher obtained corrosion rates (vcorr). Results also showed a phosphorus removal efficiency (PRem) of 16.8% with ~53 mL H2 production for pure Mg anode and 17.2% with ~61 mL H2 production for Mg AZ31 alloy. The precipitates formed on the Mg based discs were studied and analyzed by SEM, XRD, XPS, EDX while the physical characterizations of the obtained films corresponded to struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate - MgNH4PO4*6H2O). It was found that (i) the thickness of the films was influenced by the applied scan rates, which also had a significant impact on the morphology, and (ii) hydrogen bubble formation influenced the precipitates whereby the film thicknesses were negatively impacted.","Chemistry",NA,"2021-06-29","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo (University of Arkansas)                                                    Abolhassani, Mojtaba (University of Arkansas)                                                    Greenlee, Lauren (University of Arkansas)                                                    Pollet, Bruno (Norwegian University of Science and Technology)","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo; Abolhassani, Mojtaba; Greenlee, Lauren; Pollet, Bruno, 2021, ""An electrochemical study of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate on Mg and Mg alloy electrodes"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WI7R6X, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"", ""AZ 100mvs.jpg"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"669",669,"The Electrochemistry of Ammonium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate, Ammonium Chloride on Mg-based and Polycrystalline Pt Electrodes","In this study, the electrochemical mechanisms of struvite formation were investigated by studying the behaviour of Mg-based and (poly)crystalline-Pt electrodes in the presence of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium phosphate, and ammonium chloride solutions. It was found that a precipitate was formed on the Mg-based electrodes, while the poly-Pt electrode showed typical voltammetric features in aqueous electrolytes. The structure, morphology, and composition of the electrochemically obtained precipitates collected from the surface of the Mg-based electrodes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the precipitate morphology was impacted by the composition of the electrolytes and the purity of the magnesium. Moreover, the Tafel kinetics and corrosion rates (vcorr) directly correlated with the electrolyte and the electrode material compositions, whereby both showed a general increase when the Mg-based electrodes were employed in the presence of chloride anions. The Tafel slopes (β) obtained for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the poly-Pt electrode showed a significant difference between the forward and reverse potential scans in the various electrolytes used, a finding which was mainly attributed to the adsorption of hydroxide species, alkali cations, and phosphate anions to the surface whereby these species blocked the ORR active sites.","Chemistry",NA,"2021-06-29","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo (University of Arkansas)                                                    Abolhassani, Mojtaba (University of Arkansas)                                                    Greenlee, Lauren (University of Arkansas)                                                    Pollet, Bruno (Norwegian University of Science and Technology)","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo","Kekedy-Nagy, Laszlo; Abolhassani, Mojtaba; Greenlee, Lauren; Pollet, Bruno, 2021, ""The Electrochemistry of Ammonium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate, Ammonium Chloride on Mg-based and Polycrystalline Pt Electrodes"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CUFKKI, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"", ""1-1_004.jpg"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

Methods: the methods used were the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique, with the application of the output-oriented constant returns scale (CRS) model; the initial combinatorial multicriteria method for choosing the input variables; and Tobit regression as a validation strategy for the DEA model. Results: of the twelve railways evaluated, three railways were identified as efficient: Estrada de Ferro Carajás, Fortescue, and Mount Newman. Conclusions: the applied model was considered a good method to evaluate the efficiency of railways specialized in transporting MFe and PLMFe, as it determined the efficiency of each railway, suggesting the necessary increase in the output variable or adjustments in the input variables so that the railways reach the efficiency frontier. With that, companies can use the results of this study to guide future improvements to make their railways more efficient or maintain them on the frontier of efficiency.","Business and Management","railways specialized in iron ore and pellets, data envelopment analysis, rail freight transport efficiency","2021-06-30","Renata Guimarães de Oliveira Fontan (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2516-3514                                                    Rodrigo Alvarenga Rosa (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0841-514X                                                    Adonai José Lacruz (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1575-3788","Journal of Contemporary Administration","Renata Guimarães de Oliveira Fontan; Rodrigo Alvarenga Rosa; Adonai José Lacruz, 2021, ""Replication Data for: The efficiency of railways specialized in transporting iron ore and pellets"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Y8CS9Q, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:exiNkAC+EYoQqIwVYyYsxQ== [fileUNF]","c(""RAC-Dataset.tab"", ""RAC-Dataset.tab"", ""RAC-Dataset.tab"")","c(0, 0, NA)","c(13, NA, NA)","c(12, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. We analyze eGFR data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and Michigan Genomics Initiative and perform a GWAS meta-analysis with public summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identify 147 loci (53 novel) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Additionally, sex-stratified analysis identifies one locus with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD with only modest improvements in detection compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD.

"693",693,"The Issues are the Issues: Intangible Salience and War Duration","While it has long been acknowledged that issues play an important role in conflict processes, research on war duration has paid insufficient attention to them. In this paper, I help to remedy this deficiency by devising an original theory concerning the role of issues in war. I do this by focusing on the tangibility of the issues under dispute. I contend as the intangible salience increases, the more difficult it will be for states to bring their wars to an end. Ultimately, the more intangible salience that the issues possess, the longer wars will be. I use a mixed-methods approach. In the quantitative analysis, I employ original measures of intangible salience using data from a world-wide expert survey as well as new data on issues fought over during war. In the qualitative portion, I perform an in-depth case study on the effects of the issues on the war duration during the Vietnam War. Ultimately, I find strong support for my assertions that the issues lead states to engage in war prolongation behavior which in turn leads to longer wars.

"711",711,"Data from: Phenotypic plasticity of natural Populus trichocarpa populations in response to temporally environmental change in a common garden","Natural selection on fitness-related traits can be temporally heterogeneous among populations. As climate changes, understanding population-level responses is of scientific and practical importance. We examined 18 phenotypic traits associated with phenology, biomass, and ecophysiology in 403 individuals of natural Populus trichocarpa populations, growing in a common garden. Compared with tree origin settings, propagules likely underwent drought exposures in the common garden due to significantly low rainfall during the years of measurement. All study traits showed population differentiation reflecting adaptive responses due to local genetic adaptation. Phenology and biomass traits were strongly under selection and showed plastic responses between years, co-varying with latitude. While phenological events (e.g., bud set and growth period) and biomass were under positive directional selection, post-bud set period, particularly from final bud set to the onset of leaf drop, was selected against. With one exception to water-use efficiency, ecophysiology traits were under negative directional selection. Moreover, extended phenological events jointly evolved with source niches under increased temperature and decreased rainfall exposures. High biomass coevolved with climatic niches of high temperature; low rainfall promoted high photosynthetic rates evolution. This work underpins that P. trichocarpa is likely to experience increased fitness (height gain) by evolving toward extended bud set and growth period, abbreviated post-bud set period, and increased drought resistance, potentially constituting a powerful mechanism for long-lived tree species in surviving unpredictably environmental extremes (e.g., drought).","Earth and Environmental Sciences; Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Plasticity, Adaptation, Field experiment","2021-06-20","Liu, Yang (University of British Columbia) - ORCID: 0000-0002-3479-9223                                                    El-Kassaby, Yousry A.

In reality, despite visible benefits of many of the new agricultural technologies, including machinery and management practices, farmers either do not adopt them or it takes a long time to begin the adoption process and scaling up. To enhance the provision of irrigation using surface water and to enhance irrigation efficiency, Bangladesh has been trying to introduce the Axial-Flow-Pump (AFP) appropriate for surface water irrigation, which can lift up to 55% more water, conditional on the water head, than a conventional centrifugal pump. Despite the visible benefit of AFP, the uptake of AFP for irrigation is low in the targeted zone of Bangladesh. The present study demonstrates that the new technology must be modified to adapt to local demand and specifications. Most importantly, the price of the new technology must be competitive with the prices of the existing available substitute technologies to ensure a rapid uptake and scaling up of a new agricultural technology.

Leading theories in developmental research have proposed that having a general preference for solitude may incur significant interpersonal costs, but empirical studies are still lacking. In five studies (total N = 1,823), we tested whether target individuals with a higher preference for solitude were at greater risk for ostracism, a common, yet extremely negative, experience. In studies using self-reported experiences (Study 1) and perceptions of others’ experiences (Study 2), individuals with a stronger preference for solitude were more likely to experience ostracism. Moreover, participants were more willing to ostracize targets with a high (vs. low) preference for solitude (Studies 3 and 4). Why do people ostracize solitude-seeking individuals? Participants assumed that interacting with these individuals would be aversive for themselves and the targets (Study 5; preregistered).

Constituents’ weight and structural complexity seem to be significant determinants in the occurrence of linguistic movement rules and the ultimate constituent ordering. The ultimate structural configuration is thought to be compliant with processing ease. Adopting an eye tracking technique, this research aims to study eye behavior in response to processing difficulty of syntactically different, but semantically identical sentences and hence provide behavioral evidence for the effect of grammatical weight on the occurrence of syntactic movement in Persian language. Encompassing two syntactic movements (relative clause extraposition and postposing) in two weight levels (light, heavy), some eye behavior such as fixations, regressions, pupil size and blink analysis was registered and then assessed. It was concluded that syntactic movement is weight-sensitive and aimed at easing processing difficulty. The likelihood of post-verbal movement in extraposition and scrambling increases by the increase of grammatical weight and driven by the incentive of increasing processing efficiency.

"724",724,"Replication Data for: Migration Management in Turkey: Discourse and Practice","ABSTRACT This article analyzes the discourse and practice of migration management in Turkey. It identifies four major themes in the discourse between 2014 and 2020: Migration as a 1) burden, 2) humanitarian responsibility, 3) justification for transborder operations, and 4) fault line in Turkey-European Union (EU) relations. Then it analyzes migration management practices in three categories: 1) legal challenges, 2) agents and relations of policing, and 3) surveillance. Adopting a multimethod approach, the article combines qualitative data collection with interpretive analysis. It concludes that despite the humanitarian emphasis in political discourse, there are embedded in/security practices in the field of migration management in Turkey. Keywords: Border In/security, European Union, Immigration, Middle East, Refugee ÖZET Bu makale Türkiye’nin göç söylemi ve pratiğini incelemektedir. 2014-2020 arasındaki göç söylemini dört temel başlıkta sınıflandırmaktadır: 1) külfet olarak, 2) insani sorumluluk olarak, 3) sınır ötesi operasyonlara gerekçe olarak, 4) Türkiye-AB ilişkilerinde kırılma noktası olarak göç. Ardından, makale Türkiye’nin göç yönetimi pratiklerini üç kategoriye ayırarak incelemektedir: 1) yasal zorluklar, 2) polislik faaliyetleri ve aktörleri, 3) gözetleme faaliyetleri. Makale çoklu-yöntem yaklaşımını uygulayarak, orijinal nitel verileri yorumsamacı analiz ile incelemektedir. Makale siyasi söylemde göçün daha çok insani boyutuna odaklanılıyor olmasına rağmen, Türkiye’nin göçü sahada ele alış biçiminde yerleşik güvenlik(siz)lik pratikleri olduğu sonucuna varmaktadır.

"725",725,"Theoretical analysis of key factors achieving reversed magnetic shear q-profiles sustained with lower hybrid waves on EAST","The phase space analysis technique is applied to provide new insights into the fully non-inductive lower hybrid current driven (LHCD) discharges on EAST (Garofalo et al 2017 Nucl. Fusion 57 076037). The analysis shows that there are bounded and unbounded topologies of lower hybrid (LH) waves in phase space. For typical parameters on EAST, the propagation domain for 4.6 GHz LH waves is bounded, while unbounded for 2.45 GHz LH waves and one of the conditions is recognized to be good for achieving an off-axis current profile driven by 4.6 GHz LH waves on EAST. The parametric analysis on the potential power deposition (PPD) region for those experiments demonstrates that the reversed magnetic shear dominates the wave behavior, and confines the LH power absorption to the far off-axis region as long as it occurs in the 4.6 GHz dominated LHCD discharge. GENRAY/CQL3D simulations also confirm this effect of reversed shear on the power absorption of 4.6 GHz waves. A bounded propagation domain and a positive feedback loop between magnetic shear reversal and off-axis LHCD profile could explain the LH-only-sustained strong reversed magnetic shear observed in experiments on multiple machines. In contrast, there is no such effect for 2.45 GHz waves on EAST since the PPD region is less sensitive to the change of reversed shear due to the unbounded propagation domain.","Physics","bounded propagation domain, EAST, frequency 2.45 GHz, frequency 4.6 GHz, fully noninductive lower hybrid current driven discharges, GENRAY-CQL3D simulations, LH power absorption, Lower Hybrid waves, magnetic shear reversal, off-axis current profile, off-axis LHCD profile, parametric analysis, phase space analysis technique, positive feedback loop, potential power deposition region, reversed magnetic shear q-profiles, unbounded propagation domain, wave behavior",NA,"Zhai, X.M.; Xiang, N.; Chen, J.L.; Bonoli, P.T.; Shiraiwa, S.; Garofalo, A.M.; Yang, C.; Li, M.H.; Qian, J.P.; Li, G.Q.; Li, K.; Liu, H.Q.; Lyu, B.; Zang, Q.",NA,"Zhai, X.M.; Xiang, N.; Chen, J.L.; Bonoli, P.T.; Shiraiwa, S.; Garofalo, A.M.; Yang, C.; Li, M.H.; Qian, J.P.; Li, G.Q.; Li, K.; Liu, H.Q.; Lyu, B.; Zang, Q., 2021, ""Theoretical analysis of key factors achieving reversed magnetic shear q-profiles sustained with lower hybrid waves on EAST"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DUPB8G, Harvard Dataverse, V2","c(""19ja059_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja059_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"726",726,"Replication Data for: Reexamining the Effect of Refugees on Civil Conflict: A Global Subnational Analysis","A large literature suggests that the presence of refugees is associated with greater risk of conflict. We argue that the positive effects of hosting refugees on local conditions have been overlooked. Using global data from 1990 to 2018 on locations of refugee communities and civil conflict at the subnational level, we find no evidence that hosting refugees increases the likelihood of new conflict, prolongs existing conflict, or raises the number of violent events or casualties. Furthermore, we explore conditions where provinces are likely to experience substantively large decreases in conflict risk due to increased development. Analysis examining nighttime lights as a measure of development, coupled with expert interviews, support our claim. To address the possibility of selection bias, we use placebo tests and matching. Our research challenges assertions that refugees are security risks. Instead, we show that in many cases, hosting refugees can encourage local development and even conflict reduction.

While this time was not the period of growth of the scientific information scope, the need for panel discussions of scientific problems had already increased. It was still another 10 years before the Soviet authorities allowed trauma orthopedist congresses as a form of the panel discussion. A research and practice scientific meeting had become an efficient communication channel connecting scientists, managers, and doctors of the public healthcare system. The flows of scientific content created by the experts were presented at those meetings in the form of presentations, case studies with the presentation of patients, or surgeon's showcases. The social and political situation at the end of the 1940s and the increase of ideology control of Soviet science formed a special background for scientific medical communication. While there still was a mandatory requirement to refer Marks, Engels, Lenin, and particularly Stalin in all presentations, in the late 1940s – early 1950s the authors had to refer to Pavlov, Michurin, and Lysenko’s studies. It was a hard time and the majority of scientists followed the authorities’ requirements just technically trying to adjust to the situation and merely survive while sticking to certain professional objectives. A common layout of the meeting room back then included a presidium in the center, a skeleton in the left corner, and a Lenin portrait sculpture, and a large Stalin portrait in the right corner. The Interregional Reconstructive Surgery Meeting of the leading surgeons from local hospitals for the WWII disabled veterans exemplifies scientific medical communication in trauma and orthopedic science in the middle of the 20th century. It was held in Saratov on December 6-10, 1949 at the premises of Saratov State Scientific Research Institute of reconstructive surgery and orthopedic.","Arts and Humanities; Medicine, Health and Life Sciences; Social Sciences","history of orthopedics, history of traumatology, scientific medical communication, Saratov Traumatology, Orthopedics and Neurosurgery Institute","2021-06-28","Grishin, Sergey (YURI GAGARIN STATE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF SARATOV,Saratov State Medical University named after V.

The NI and MI REBCO pancake coils showed high thermal stability in many over-current tests. However, a disadvantage is a charging delay due to low turn-to-turn contact resistance. Therefore, many researchers have tried to increase turn-to-turn contact resistance to overcome the charging delay problem. Meanwhile, a partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) model can accurately simulate the over-current and charging/discharging tests of NI REBCO pancake coils in detail. Using the PEEC model coupling with thermal finite element analysis (FEA), the thermal stability was evaluated during a local normal-state transition. From the simulation results, it was found that a best range of turn-to-turn contact resistance existed to keep a high thermal stability during a local normal-state transition. However, the PEEC and thermal FEA method requires a substantial amount of time with complicated simulation approach. In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical formulation to obtain an appropriate range of turn-to-turn contact resistance during a local normal-state transition, supposing a worst cooling condition. The simple computation is easy to use and timesaving to roughly estimate the operation reliability of NI REBCO pancake coils.","Physics","No-insulation winding technique, quench protection, superconducting magnet",NA,"So Noguchi, Seungyong Hahn, Atsushi Ishiyama, Yukikazu Iwasa",NA,"So Noguchi, Seungyong Hahn, Atsushi Ishiyama, Yukikazu Iwasa, 2021, ""A simple protection evaluation method for no-insulation REBCO pancake coils during local normal-state transition"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VNTTH1, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""19ja009_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja009_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

However, a persistent screening current induced in the REBCO conductor under time-varying conditions distorts the magnetic field, spatially and temporally. We describe a novel REBCO conductor design composed of Narrow-Stacked (NS) wire, a bundle of 1-mm wide REBCO tapes. The design is based on a fundamental notion that the narrower the REBCO tape width, the smaller the screen-current field (SCF). In this paper, both experimental and simulation work were carried out to analyze SCF in a REBCO coil wound with an NS wire. We demonstrate that the critical current of NS wires can be consistent with the conventional REBCO tape to meet the application requirements. Meanwhile, NS wire indeed substantially results in small SCF, an important requirement in high-field magnets such as for NMR, MRI, and HEP that may rely on REBCO conductor.","Physics","field homogeneity, Narrow-Stacked wire, REBCO coated conductor, Screening current induced field, Temporal field stability",NA,"Mingyang Wang, Zhuyong Li, Yufan Yan, Min Zhang, Jie Sheng, Zhiyong Hong, Zhijian Jin, Yukikazu Iwasa, Timing Qu",NA,"Mingyang Wang, Zhuyong Li, Yufan Yan, Min Zhang, Jie Sheng, Zhiyong Hong, Zhijian Jin, Yukikazu Iwasa, Timing Qu, 2021, ""A novel REBCO conductor design to reduce screening-current field in REBCO magnets"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NSKXEU, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""19ja011_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""19ja011_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

While scholars have demonstrated that diasporic interest groups often successfully influence US foreign policy, we take a step back to ask why only certain diasporas attempt to do so in the first place. We argue that two factors increase the likelihood of diaspora mobilization: a community’s experience with democratic governance and conflict in its country of origin. We posit that these conditions make it more likely that political entrepreneurs emerge to serve as catalysts for top-down mobilization. To test our hypotheses, we collect and analyze novel data on diasporic interest groups as well as the characteristics of their respective countries of origin.

"753",753,"The Digital Mirror Langmuir Probe: Field Programmable Gate Array Implementation of Real-Time Langmuir Probe Biasing","High bandwidth, high spatial resolution measurements of electron temperature, density and plasma potential are valuable for resolving turbulence in the boundary plasma of tokamaks. While conventional Langmuir probes can provide such measurements either their temporal or spatial resolution is limited: the former by the sweep rate necessary for obtaining I-V characteristics and the latter by the need to use multiple electrodes, as is the case in triple and double probe configurations. The Mirror Langmuir Probe (MLP) bias technique overcomes these limitations by rapidly switching the voltage on a single electrode cycling between three bias states, each dynamically optimised for the local plasma conditions. The MLP system on Alcator C-Mod used analog circuitry to perform this function, measuring Te, VF, and Isat at 1.1 MSPS. Recently, a new prototype digital MLP controller has been implemented on a Red Pitaya Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board which reproduces the functionality of the original controller and performs all data acquisition. There is also the potential to provide the plasma parameters externally for use with feedback control systems. The use of FPGA technology means the system is readily customisable at a fraction of the development time and implementation cost. A second Red Pitaya was used to test the MLP by simulating the current response of a physical probe using C-Mod experimental measurements. This project is available as a git repository to facilitate extensibility (e.g. real-time control outputs, more voltage states) and scalability through collaboration.","Physics","diagnostic techniques, diagnostic tools, FPGA, Langmuir probe, plasma",NA,"C.

"755",755,"ARC reactor materials: Activation analysis and optimization","Nowadays, Fusion Energy is one of the most important sources under study. During the last years, different designs of fusion reactors were considered. At the MIT, an innovative design was created: ARC, the Affordable Robust Compact reactor. It takes advantage of the innovative aspects of recent progress in fusion technology, such as high temperature superconductors, that permit to decrease the dimensions of the machine, reaching at the same time high magnetic fields. Our main goal is the low-activation analysis of possible structural materials for the vacuum vessel, which is designed as a single-piece placed between the first-wall and the tank that contains the breeding blanket. Due to its position, the vacuum vessel is subject to high neutron flux, which can activate it and cause the reduction of the component lifetime and decommissioning problems. The activation analysis was done also for the liquid breeder FLiBe, compared with Lithium-Lead. Codes used for the low-activation analysis were MCNP and FISPACT-II. The first one is based on a neutronics model and for each component a certain neutron flux is evaluated. For FISPACT-II, the main input is the composition of the analyzed material, the neutron flux and the irradiation time. Results from FISPACT-II are the time behavior of specific activity, contact dose rate. To assess suitable structural materials for the vacuum vessel, low-activation properties were considered. Vanadium alloys turn out to be one of the best alternatives to the present material, Inconel-718. Finally, isotopic tailoring and elemental substitution methods were applied. Here, the composition of each alloy is analyzed and critical isotopes or elements are eliminated or reduced. After the modifications, new simulations are done, and those leading to significant improvements in the final results are highlighted.","Physics","FISPACT-II, FLiBe, fusion technology, high magnetic fields, innovative design, neutronics modeling, substitution method, vacuum vessel",NA,"Bocci, B.; Hartwig, Z.; Segantin, S.; Testoni, R.; Whyte, D.; Zucchetti, M.",NA,"Bocci, B.; Hartwig, Z.; Segantin, S.; Testoni, R.; Whyte, D.; Zucchetti, M., 2021, ""ARC reactor materials: Activation analysis and optimization"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MKTOJY, Harvard Dataverse, V2","c(""20ja054_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""20ja054_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(1, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

In this paper, we estimate the conditions under which such tearing may give rise to full nonlinear magnetic reconnection in the turbulent eddies. When those conditions are met, a new turbulence regime is accessed where reconnection-driven energy dissipation becomes common, rather than the rare feature that it must be when they are not. We conclude that while such conditions are very stringent for ﬂuid-scale eddies, they are easily met for kinetic-scale eddies; in particular, we suggest that our arguments may help explain recent Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations of (so-called) electron-only reconnection and of energy dissipation via electron Landau damping in the Earthʼs magnetosheath.","Physics","electron-only reconnection, energy cascade, fluid-scale eddies, kinetic-scale eddies, magnetized turbulence, nonlinear magnetic reconnection, nonlinear reconnection, rare feature, recent analytical works, reconnection-driven energy dissipation, strong magnetized plasma turbulence, tearing instability, turbulence regime, turbulent eddies",NA,"Loureiro, N.F.; Boldyrev, S.",NA,"Loureiro, N.F.; Boldyrev, S., 2021, ""Nonlinear Reconnection in Magnetized Turbulence"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LGOKIK, Harvard Dataverse, V2","c(""20ja044_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""20ja044_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

For the global version of the code, the collision operator has been developed to allow for block-structured velocity space grids, allowing for computationally tractable collisional global simulations.

Formaggio, 2009) is to measure the absolute neutrino mass using tritium, which involves precisely measuring the energies of the beta-decay electrons in the high-energy tail of the spectrum (A. A. Esfahani et al., 2017). The experimental installation of Project 8 Atom Trapping Demonstrator requires a magnet with rather unusual field properties. The magnet has to contain within the cold mass a large volume enclosed by a continuous, uninterrupted boundary higher than 2 T, whereas the field in a substantial volume inside this boundary has to be of the order of 10−4 T or less. A 1-T solenoid field provides the background field necessary for the detection of the beta-decay electrons (A. A. Esfahani et al., 2019). A proposed toroidal magnet system [a Ioffe-Pritchard trap (T. Bergeman et al., 1987)] comprised of specially shaped multiple racetrack windings with opposing polarities satisfies these unusual requirements. Themagnet is made of NbTi wire and expected to be conduction cooled. Manufacturability issues are addressed as well as the effect of tolerances on the field quality. The design includes additional topological features providing a low-field duct for interfacing with the peripheral coils of the velocity and state selector.","Physics","absolute neutrino mass, background field, beta-decay electrons, field quality, high-energy tail, ioffe trap magnet, Ioffe-Pritchard trap, low-field duct, Project 8 Atom Trapping Demonstrator, project 8 experiment, solenoid field, toroidal magnet system, unusual field properties",NA,"Radovinsky, A.L.; Lindman, A.; Formaggio, J.A.; Minervini, J.V.",NA,"Radovinsky, A.L.; Lindman, A.; Formaggio, J.A.; Minervini, J.V., 2021, ""A Ioffe Trap Magnet for the Project 8 Atom Trapping Demonstrator"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FDQF0Y, Harvard Dataverse, V2","c(""20ja037_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""20ja037_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"
"759",759,"A second order yield-temperature relation for accurate inference of burn-averaged quantities in multi-species plasmas","Measured yields and ion temperatures inferred from the fusion product energy spectra can be used as metrics for the performance of an ICF implosion. This can be to infer species separation, thermal decoupling, flows or other effects that can cause the inferred ion temperatures to deviate from the true underlying thermal temperature and the yield ratio to deviate from the expected value. Direct inference of the impact of these effects on observed temperatures and yields can be difficult to uncover due to underlying dependence on the shape and time evolution of the temperature and density pro les of the fusing plasma. Due to differences in the temperature dependence of the reactivities, different fusion products are emitted from different regions and times within the implosion. In order to properly account for this, a second order analytic expression relating the apparent temperatures and yield ratios is developed. This expression can be coupled to models of yield and/or temperature altering effects to infer their burn-averaged impact on an implosion. The second order expression shows significant improvement over lower order expressions in synthetic data studies. Demonstrations of its applications to synthetic data coupled with models of ion thermal decoupling and radial flows are presented. In the case of thermal decoupling both first and second order expressions show reasonable levels of accuracy. To consistently infer the amplitude of radial flow with <10% error the second order equation is required.","Physics","Burn Weighting, fusion, ICF, MFE, NIF [National Ignition Facility], OMEGA Laser Facility",NA,"N.

Fusion reactions producing monoenergetic particles, such as D3He, are commonly used as a source, produced by a capsule implosion. Using smaller capsules for radiography applications is advantageous as the source size decreases, but on the NIF this is complicated by the risk introduced from increasing blow-by light, since the phase plate focal spot size is much larger than the capsules. We report a demonstration of backlighter targets where a ‘Saturn’ ring is placed around the capsule to block this light. The nuclear performance of the backlighters is unperturbed by the addition of a ring. We also test a ring with an equatorial cutout, which severely aﬀects the proton emission and is not viable for radiography applications.

This article examines the media coverage of vote intention polls in the Netherlands. We assess whether the quality of media reporting on polls depends on the availability of information regarding the quality in pollster’s reports. Our analysis of the quality looks at three different quality measures: (1) mentioning WAPOR items, such as field dates, sampling method, and polling method, (2) mentioning the margin of error, and (3) the correct interpretation of (in)significant changes and differences. The Netherlands provides an interesting case, because there is variation over time and across pollsters in the way they report their polls as well as the increased popularity of a polling aggregator. Our findings indicate that the overall quality of Dutch coverage of polls is low. When a pollster mentions the margin of error in its report, media reports on that poll are more likely to include this information and to correctly interpret the significance of differences between two parties. This effect is particularly visible when the pollster provides uncertainty intervals in its headline figures.

In order to define ARC’s role in future electricity grids, a feasibility investigation of the load-following concept has been carried out, starting on ARC’s vacuum vessel (VV), which is the component closest to the plasma. Finite element analysis models have been designed, and thermomechanical analyses have been conducted. In this framework thermal fatigue and creep remain the main issues. This study identifies and verifies a suitable temperature range for the VV coolant. Indeed, it is found to satisfy both requirements for the lifetime of the structural material and thermodynamic efficiency optimization.","Physics","finite element analysis model, fusion reactor designs, innovative materials, load-following capabilities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thermo-mechanical analysis, thermodynamic efficiency, tokamak",NA,"Segantin, S.; Testoni, R.; Hartwig, Z.; Whyte, D.; Zucchetti, M.",NA,"Segantin, S.; Testoni, R.; Hartwig, Z.; Whyte, D.; Zucchetti, M., 2021, ""Exploration of a Fast Pathway to Nuclear Fusion: Thermal Analysis and Cooling Design Considerations for the ARC Reactor"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DBKCME, Harvard Dataverse, V2","c(""20ja060_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""20ja060_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(3, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"779",779,"Scattering of Radio Frequency Waves by Density Filaments","The edge region and the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined fusion devices, like tokamaks and stellarators, are replete with turbulent plasma that is a mixture of coherent, blob or filament like, structures [1] and incoherent fluctuations [2]. The variation in the density due to turbulence can be comparable to or greater than the ambient density [2]. As part of an overall effort to optimize the efficiency of operation, radio frequency (RF) waves are commonly used for heating fusion plasmas and, in tokamaks, for generating plasma current needed for confinement and controlling instabilities. The RF waves are excited by antenna structures that are placed near the wall of a fusion device. In order to deliver energy and momentum to charged particles in the core of fusion plasmas, RF waves have to propagate through the turbulent plasma. In present fusion devices, the scrap-off layer and the edge plasma region is of the order of a few centimeters. In reactor type devices, like ITER, this region is expected to be of the order of tens of centimeters. Since the efficiency of operation of a fusion reactor is of prime importance, it is imperative that we understand the effect of turbulence on RF waves. The fluctuations in density lead to changes in the plasma permittivity. As in conventional electrodynamics, the propagation of RF waves through different dielectric media is subject to reflection, refraction, and diffraction. In this paper, we summarize our theoretical and computational studies on the propagation of RF waves through filamentary structures present in the scrape-off layer.","Physics","diffraction reflection and refraction of waves, homogenization techniques, propagation of radio frequency waves, Scattering of radio frequency wave, scattering of waves by turbulence",NA,"Abhay K.

"784",784,"Experimental studies of plasma-antenna coupling with the JET Alfven Eigenmode Active Diagnostic","This paper presents a dedicated study of plasma-antenna (PA) coupling with the Alfven Eigenmode Active Diagnostic (AEAD) in JET. Stable AEs and their resonant frequencies f, damping rates gamma < 0, and toroidal mode numbers n are measured for various PA separations and limiter versus X-point magnetic configurations. Two stable AEs are observed to be resonantly excited at distinct low and high frequencies in limiter plasmas. The values of f and n do not vary with PA separation. However, |gamma| increases with PA separation for the low-f, but not high-f, mode, yet this may be due to slightly different edge conditions. The high-f AE is detected throughout the transition from limiter to X-point configuration, though its damping rate increases; the low-f mode, on the other hand, becomes unidentifiable. The linear resistive MHD code CASTOR is used to simulate the frequency scan of an AEAD-like external antenna. For the limiter pulses, the high-f mode is determined to be an n = 0 GAE, while the low-f mode is likely an n = 2 TAE.

The high neutron fluence component of the FNSF mission requires steady-state operation for extremely long pulses (t_{pulse} ∼ months) at full power. Plasma sustainment and current drive will be critical components of a successful FNSF. COMSOL Multiphysics software is used for combined radiofrequency (RF) and thermal simulations of the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) antenna system. These simu- lations consider the resistive RF losses in the antenna including realistic surface roughness and a range of potential materials. The thermal analysis adds volumetric nuclear heating, plasma heat flux on leading edges, and electromagnetic radiation from the plasma to the RF heating calculated by COMSOL. Additional neutronics calculations have been performed to determine the impact of these antenna designs on activated waste disposal for the materials considered. The simulations show that it is technically feasible to implement a fully-active multi-junction (FAM) rather than a passive-active multi-junction (PAM) style of antenna if the septum between adjacent waveguides is sufficiently wide and the thermal conductivity of the structural material is sufficiently high. The FAM has the benefit of higher achievable power density with respect to the PAM, which results in a more compact antenna with potentially lower impact on neutron shielding and tritium breeding. These considerations point to tungsten rather than steel as the preferred structural material in constructing the antenna.","Physics","fusion nuclear science facility, lower hybrid current drive, microwave, Multiphysics Simulation, radio frequency",NA,"G.M.

"788",788,"Replication Data for: Physics based machine learning for sub-cellular segmentation in living cells","Abstract: Segmenting sub-cellular structures in living cells from fluorescence microscopy images is a ground truth (GT) hard problem. The microscope’s 3-dimensional blurring function, finite optical resolution due to light diffraction, finite pixel resolution, and complex morphological manifestations of the structures, all contribute to GT-hardness. Unsupervised segmentation approaches are quite inaccurate. Manual segmentation relying of heuristics and experience therefore remains the preferred approach. Nonetheless, this process is tedious, with 100s of structures present inside a single cell. Thus, generating analytic across large population of cells or performing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tasks such as tracking is greatly limited. We bring modeling and deep learning to a nexus for solving this GT-hard problem, improving both the accuracy and speed of sub-cellular segmentation. We introduce the approach of simulation-supervision empowered with physics-based GT. In the simulation-supervision datasets used for training, the physics-based GT resolves the GT hardness while computational modeling of all the relevant physics aspects assists deep learning models to learn to compensate for physics and instrument induced limitations to a great extent. We show extensive results on segmentation of small vesicles and large diversity of mitochondria in diverse independent living and fixed cell datasets, demonstrate the adaptability of the approach across diverse microscopes through transfer learning, and illustrate biologically-relevant applications of automated analytic and motion analysis.

To optimize the measurement precision, the amplifier was operated at 47 kV and 1 A, where the output power was ~30 W. The phase was determined to be stable both pulse-to-pulse and during each pulse, so far as the cathode voltage and electron beam current are constant. The phase variation with voltage was measured and found to be 130 ± 30 deg/kV, in excellent agreement with simulations. The electron gun used in this device is non-adiabatic, resulting in a steep slope of the beam pitch factor with respect to cathode voltage. This was discovered to be the dominant factor in the phase dependence on voltage. The use of an adiabatic electron gun is predicted to yield a significantly smaller phase sensitivity to voltage, and thus a more phase-stable performance. To our knowledge, these are the first phase measurements reported for a gyro-amplifier operating at a frequency above W-band.","Physics","DNP-NMR, gyro-amplifiers, gyrotorn, phase stability, vacuum electronics",NA,"Guy Rosenzweig, Sudheer K.

"790",790,"Hybrid deep learning architecture for general disruption prediction across tokamaks","In this paper, we present a new deep learning disruption prediction algorithm based on important findings from explorative data analysis which effectively allows knowledge transfer from existing devices to new ones, thereby predicting disruptions using very limited disruptive data from the new devices. The explorative data analysis conducted via unsupervised clustering techniques confirms that time-sequence data are much better separators of disruptive and non-disruptive behavior than the instantaneous plasma state data with further advantageous implications for a sequence-based predictor. Based on such important findings, we have designed a new algorithm for multi-machine disruption prediction that achieves high predictive accuracy on the C-Mod (AUC=0.801), DIII-D (AUC=0.947) and EAST (AUC=0.973). tokamaks with limited hyperparameter tuning. Through numerical experiments, we show that boosted accuracy (AUC=0.959) is achieved on EAST predictions by including in the training only 20 disruptive discharges, thousands of non-disruptive discharges from EAST, and combining this with more than a thousand discharges from DIII-D and C-Mod. The improvement of predictive ability obtained by combining disruptive data from other devices is found to be true for all permutations of the three devices. Furthermore, by comparing the predictive performance of each individual numerical experiment, we find that non-disruptive data are machine-specific while disruptive data from multiple devices contain device-independent knowledge that can be used to inform predictions for disruptions occurring on a new device.","Physics","disruption prediction, instability, machine learning, stability, tokamak",NA,"J.X.

"792",792,"Reimagining full wave rf quasilinear theory in a tokamak","The velocity dependent resonant interaction of particles with applied radio frequency (rf) waves during heating and current drive in the presence of pitch angle scattering collisions gives rise to narrow collisional velocity space boundary layers that dramatically enhance the role of collisions as recently shown by Catto (J. Plasma Phys., vol. 86, 815860302, 2020). The behavior is a generalization of the narrow collisional boundary layer that forms during Landau damping as found by Johnston (Phys. Fluids, vol. 14, 1971, pp. 2719-2726) and Auerbach (Phys. Fluids, vol. 20, 1977, pp. 1836-1844). For a wave of parallel wave number k|| interacting with weakly collisional plasma species of collision frequency ν and thermal speed vth , the effective collision frequency becomes of order ν(k_||v_th /ν)^2/3>> ν . The narrow boundary layers that arise because of the diffusive nature of the collisions allows a physically meaningful wave-particle interaction time to be defined that is the inverse of this effective collision frequency. The collisionality implied by the narrow boundary layer results in changes in the standard quasilinear treatment of applied rf fields in tokamaks while remaining consistent with causality. These changes occur because successive poloidal interactions with the rf are correlated in tokamak geometry and because the resonant velocity space dependent interactions are controlled by the spatial and temporal behavior of the perturbed full wave fields rather than just the spatially local Landau and Doppler shifted cyclotron wave-particle resonance condition associated with unperturbed motion of the particles. The correlation of successive poloidal circuits of the tokamak leads to the appearance in the quasilinear operator of transit averaged resonance conditions localized in velocity space boundary layers that maintain negative definite entropy production.","Physics","full wave, narrow collisional, pitch angle scattering collisions, poloidal interactions, rf quasilinear",NA,"Peter J.

"793",793,"A semi-supervised machine learning detector for physics events in tokamak discharges","Databases of physics events have been used in various fusion research applications, including the development of scaling laws and disruption avoidance algorithms, yet they can be time-consuming and tedious to construct. This paper presents a novel application of the label spreading semi-supervised learning algorithm to accelerate this process by detecting distinct events in a large dataset of discharges, given few manually labeled examples. A high detection accuracy (>85%) for H-L back transitions and initially rotating locked modes is demonstrated on a dataset of hundreds of discharges from DIII-D with manually identified events for which only 3 discharges are initially labeled by the user. Lower yet reasonable performance (~75%) is also demonstrated for the core radiative collapse, an event with a much lower prevalence in the dataset. Additionally, analysis of the performance sensitivity indicates that the same set of algorithmic parameters is optimal for each event. This suggests that the method can be applied to detect a variety of other events not included in this paper, given that the event is well described by a set of 0D signals robustly available on many discharges. Procedures for analysis of new events are demonstrated, showing automatic event detection with increasing fidelity as the user strategically adds manually labeled examples. Detections on Alcator C-Mod and EAST are also shown, demonstrating the potential for this to be used on a multi-tokamak dataset.","Physics","DIII-D, disruption, disruption avoidance, disruption prediction, event detection, machine learning, OMFIT, semi-supervised",NA,"Kevin Joseph Montes, Cristina Rea, Roy Alexander Tinguely, Ryan Sweeney, Jinxiang Zhu, Robert Granetz",NA,"Kevin Joseph Montes, Cristina Rea, Roy Alexander Tinguely, Ryan Sweeney, Jinxiang Zhu, Robert Granetz, 2021, ""A semi-supervised machine learning detector for physics events in tokamak discharges"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2LGWJR, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"", ""20ja074_fig01a_data.h5"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

Experimental yields on the OMEGA Laser System, however, have shown much less sensitivity to this initial target offset. This paper presents simulations of offset ICF implosions improved by including a physics model of cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a mechanism of laser energy scattering from one beam to another. Room-temperature OMEGA implosion experiments with prescribed target offsets are simulated with and without CBET, illustrating that CBET mitigates the ℓ = 1 implosion asymmetry from target offset. Comparison of simulations to multiple complementary experimental observables indicates the addition of CBET physics in offset simulations is necessary to match experimental results.","Physics","capsule offsets, cross beam energy transfer, direct drive, inertial confinement fusion, radiation hydrodynamics simulation",NA,"K.

Six of eight toroidally spaced antennas, each with independent power and phasing, were successful in actively exciting stable MHD modes in 479 plasmas. In total, 4768 magnetic resonances were detected with up to fourteen fast magnetic probes. In this work, we present the calculations of resonant frequencies f0, damping rates \gamma < 0, and toroidal mode numbers n, spanning the parameter range f0 = 30 - 250 kHz, -\gamma = 0 - 13 kHz, and |n| < 30. In general, good agreement is seen between the resonant and the calculated toroidal Alfven Eigenmode frequencies, and between the toroidal mode numbers applied by the AEAD and estimated of the excited resonances. We note several trends in the database: the probability of resonance detection decreases with plasma current and external heating power; the normalized damping rate increases with edge safety factor but decreases with external heating. These results provide key information to prepare future experimental campaigns and to better understand the physics of excitation and damping of Alfven Eigenmodes in the presence of alpha particles during the upcoming DT campaign, thereby extrapolating with confidence to future tokamaks.","Physics","Alfven eigenmodes, damping rate, fast magnetics, stability, toroidal mode numbers",NA,"R.A.

This work describes a methodology to constrain the physics in convergent HED experiments by adapting the methods common to many other fields of physics. As an example, a mechanical model of an imploding shell is constrained by data from a thin-shelled direct-drive exploding-pusher experiment on the OMEGA Laser System using Bayesian inference, resulting in the reconstruction of the shell dynamics and energy transfer during the implosion. The model is tested by analyzing synthetic data from a 1-D hydrodynamics code and is sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to generate the posterior distributions of the model parameters.

"810",810,"Mildly relativistic collisionless shock formed by magnetic piston","By using particle-in-cell simulations, we study the collision of two plasma flows with one of them carrying a magnetic field. Ion interpenetration results in the formation of a magnetic piston with the magnetic field compression proportional to the density ratio of the colliding plasmas. The counterpropagating ions in the nonmagnetized plasma upstream from the piston excite the ion Weibel instability, which turns into magnetic turbulence. The thickness of the piston increases with time, and it turns into a reverse magnetized shock after less than one ion gyro period. In front of the piston, the time needed to decrease the nonmagnetized ion anisotropy using the magnetic turbulence is much larger than the ion gyroperiod in the piston. Consequently, particles are reflected by the piston, which acts as a wall initiating a transient phase. After several ion periods, the formation of this electromagnetic forward shock is, then, accelerated by the piston, and at large timescale, the dissipation of energy is eventually mediated only by the Weibel turbulence. We report here a new configuration of shocks, where a reverse magnetized and a forward electromagnetic shock coexist separated by a tangential discontinuity. Particle acceleration and heating in the two shock structures and relevance of this scenario of collisionless shock formation to laboratory experiments and astrophysical conditions are discussed.","Physics","laboratory astrophysics, magnetized shocks, particle in cell codes, plasma collisionality, weibel instability",NA,"Q.

Intermediate energy proton beams can now be dedicated to materials irradiation within university-scale laboratories. This paper describes the first such facility, with an Ionetix ION-12SC cyclotron producing 12 MeV proton beams. Samples are mm-scale tensile specimens with thicknesses up to300 μm, mounted to a cooled beam target with control over temperature. A specialized tensile tester for radioactive specimens at high temperature (500+°C) and/or vacuum represents the conditions in fission and fusion systems, while a digital image correlation system remotely measures strain. Overall, the facility provides university-scale irradiation and testing capability with intermediate energy protons to complement traditional in-core fission reactor and micro-scale ion irradiation. This facility demonstrates that bulk proton irradiation is a scalable and effective approach for nuclear materials research, down-selection, and qualification.","Physics","Intermediate energy proton irradiation, Irradiation facility, nuclear materials, radiation damage, superconducting cyclotron",NA,"S.J.

Understanding the CR-39 response to protons incident at an angle is important for designing charged particle detectors for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. This study considers protons with incident energies less than 3 MeV. In this regime, an incident angle of 10° has no effect on CR-39 detection efficiency, and >85% detection efficiency is preserved up through 25° in the range of 1.0 MeV–2.1 MeV. For ICF applications, incident angles above 30° are deemed impractical for detector design due to significant drops in proton detection at all energies. We observe significant reductions in detection efficiency compared to theoretical predictions, particularly at low energies where proton tracks are etched away. The proton track diameter measured by the scan system is observed to decrease with higher incident angles. The track diameters are analyzed with two fitting models, and it is shown that the diameter–energy relation can be fit with the existing models at angles up to 30°. The optical contrast of the tracks tends to increase with the angle, meaning that the tracks are fainter, and a larger increase is observed for higher energies. Eccentricity, a measure of how elongated proton tracks are, increases with the incident angle and drops after the critical angle. The lowest energy tracks remain nearly circular even at higher angles.","Physics","CR-39 detectors, diagnostic tools, fusion experiments, Neutron detectors, proton diagnostics",NA,"R. Przybocki, M.

They want to sway voters maximally, yet voters may discount predictions that are inconsistent with what they already hold to be true. Should political actors moderate or exaggerate their predictions to maximize persuasion? I extend the Bayesian learning model to account for confirmation bias and show that only under strong confirmation bias are predictions far from the priors of voters self-defeating. I use a pre-registered survey experiment to determine whether and how voters discount predictions conditional on the distance between their prior beliefs and the predictions. I find that voters assess predictions far from their prior beliefs as less credible and, consequently, update less. The paper has important implications for strategic communication by showing theoretically and empirically that the prior beliefs of voters constrain political actors.

Structural approaches, which fit models on previous elections and fundamentals such as economic performance, are less influenced by idiosyncratic events and can establish baseline expectations about election outcomes. However, they suffer from high uncertainty and underspecification imposed by small samples. We present an early forecast for the 2021 election to Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, that remedies the small-sample problem by predicting general election vote shares in the 16 German states (Länder) using economic and political data as well as state parliament election results. As Länder elections are dispersed over the calendar, they allow us to capture both actual voter preferences and new political issues. We then combine our aggregated national forecast with polling data using a weighted average that increasingly favors polls as the election nears.

"826",826,"Morphologic and metabolic data of Philaenus spumarius froghoppers","AbstractThe xylem sap of vascular plants is an unlikely source of nutrition, being both nutrient poor and held under tensions (negative pressures) that can exceed 1 MPa. But some insects feed on xylem sap exclusively, extracting copious quantities using a muscular cibarial pump. However, neither the strength of the insect’s suction, nor the direct energetic cost of xylem ingestion, have ever been quantified. Philaenus spumarius froghoppers were used to address these gaps in our knowledge. Micro-CT scans of its cibarium and measurements of cibarial muscle sarcomere length revealed that P. spumarius can generate a maximum tension of 1.3 ± 0.2 MPa within its cibarium. The energetic cost of xylem extraction was quantified using respirometry to measure the metabolic rate (MR) of P. spumarius while they fed on hydroponically-grown legumes, while xylem sap excretion rate and cibarial pumping frequency were simultaneously recorded. Increasing the plants’ xylem tensions up to 1.1 MPa by exposing their roots to polyethylene glycol did not reduce the insects’ rate of xylem excretion, but significantly increased both MR and pumping frequency. We conclude that P. spumarius can gain energy feeding on xylem sap containing previously reported energy densities and at xylem tensions up to their maximum suction capacity.

"829",829,"Climate change exacerbates nutrient disparities from seafood","AbstractSeafood is an important source of bioavailable micronutrients supporting human health, yet it is unclear how climate change will influence its availability.  Here, combining observational databases and predictive models, we assess nutrient availability from fisheries and mariculture in the past, and project their future under climate change. Since the 1990s, availability of iron, calcium, omega-3 and protein from seafood has declined, with increasing contributions of invertebrates and mariculture failing to compensate for these loses. Nutrient availability is projected to decrease at a rate of 10 - 12% per degree Celsius of warming in low-income countries where they are already highly dependent on seafood-derived nutrients. We demonstrate the importance of achieving the Paris Agreement to supporting nutritional security and global health equity, particularly for low-income nations.  (2021-06-23)","Other",NA,"2021-06-23","Cheung, William (University of British Columbia) - ORCID: 0000-0001-9998-0384                                                    Maire, Eva (Lancaster University)                                                    Oyinlola, Muhammed (University of British Columbia)                                                    Robinson, James (Lancaster University)                                                    Graham, Nicholas (Lancaster University)                                                    MacNeil, Aaron (Dalhousie University)                                                    Hicks, Christina (Dalhousie University)",NA,"Cheung, William; Maire, Eva; Oyinlola, Muhammed; Robinson, James; Graham, Nicholas; MacNeil, Aaron; Hicks, Christina, 2021, ""Climate change exacerbates nutrient disparities from seafood"", https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/O4ZXS3, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Harvard Dataverse"

However, underrepresentation of scholarly groups casts doubt on fairness, which is currently raising concerns about a gender bias in the peer review process of premier scholarly journals such as the American Political Science Review (APSR). In this study we examine gender differences in APSR reviewing during the period 2007-2020. Our explorative analysis suggests that male reviewers privilege male authors and female reviewers female authors, while manuscripts reviewed by both male and female reviewers indicate fewer gender bias. Using within manuscript variation to address confounding effects, we then show that manuscripts reviewed by both male and female reviewers receive a more positive evaluation by female reviewers in terms of recommendation and sentiment, while they experience a marginally longer duration. Because these effects are not specific for type of authorship, we recommend that invitations should reflect mixed compositions of peers, which may also avoid overburdening an underrepresented group with review workload.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-06-23","Thomas König (University of Mannheim)                                                    Ropers, Guido (University of Mannheim) - ORCID: 0000-0001-5069-2699","Ropers, Guido","Thomas König; Ropers, Guido, 2021, ""Replication Data for: How Gendered is the Peer Review Process?

"838",838,"Pitfalls in quantifying exploration in reward-based motor learning: simulated datasets","When learning a movement based on binary success information, one is more variable following failure than following success. Theoretically, the additional variability post failure might reflect exploration of possibilities to obtain success. When average behavior is changing (as in learning), variability can be estimated from differences between subsequent movements. Can one estimate exploration reliably from such trial-to-trial changes when studying reward-based motor learning? To answer this question, we tried to reconstruct the exploration underlying learning as described by four existing reward-based motor learning models. We simulated learning for various learner and task characteristics. If we simply determined the additional change post failure, estimates of exploration were sensitive to learner and task characteristics. We identified two pitfalls in quantifying exploration based on trial-to-trial changes. Firstly, performance-dependent feedback can cause correlated samples of motor noise and exploration on successful trials, which biases exploration estimates. Secondly, the trial relative to which trial-to-trial change is calculated may also contain exploration, which causes underestimation. As a solution, we developed the additional trial-to-trial change (ATTC) method. By moving the reference trial one trial back and subtracting trial-to-trial changes following specific sequences of trial outcomes, exploration can be estimated reliably for the three models that explore based on the outcome of only the previous trial. Since ATTC estimates are based on a selection of trial sequences, this method requires many trials. In conclusion, if exploration is a binary function of previous trial outcome, the ATTC method allows for a model-free quantification of exploration.

Merging evidence indicate that such constitutional alterations, albeit occurring at a low mosaic level, may confer risk of disease later in life. Given their inherently low incidence rate and mosaic nature, there is a need for bioinformatic tools specifically designed to analyse such events. We have developed a method (ramr) to identify aberrantly methylated DNA regions (AMRs). ramr can be applied to methylation data obtained by array or next-generation sequencing techniques to discover AMRs being associated with elevated risk of cancer as well as other diseases. We assessed accuracy and performance metrics of ramr and confirmed its applicability for analysis of large public data sets. Using ramr we identified aberrantly methylated regions that are known or may potentially be associated with development of colorectal cancer and provided functional annotation of AMRs that arise at early developmental stages.

In previous work we documented a language change in North Saami in which the possessive suffix (“SOG”) as in girjji-id-easkka [book-ACC.PL-3PL] ‘their books’ is being replaced by an analytic construction with the reflexive genitive ieža-form, as in iežaska girjjiid ‘their books’. According to typologists, alienable/inalienable distinctions arise primarily in small languages where a language change takes place, and inalienability is marked by the synthetic construction. North Saami possessive constructions comport with these features, and SOG tends to mark inalienable possession, as opposed to the more neutral and widespread ieža-form. Statistical analysis shows that word frequency cannot account for the distribution of SOG vs. ieža-form, justifying focus on semantics. North Saami shows high frequency of SOG for kinship and body part nouns associated with inalienability cross-linguistically, but in addition extends this category to words for friends. A new finding is the strong presence of SOG with words for products and experiences, and additionally words connected with identity and way of life.

The elliptical sidewall was predicted to suppress the internal dark current and the lower order multipactor modes as compared with a previously tested structure having a straight sidewall. During the conditioning phase of the elliptical sidewall structure, strong internal dark current generated by an N = 1 multipactor mode was observed at gradients in the 10 to 20 MV/m range. After conditioning with 2.2x10^5 pulses to 93 MV/m, the N = 1 mode was completely suppressed and no multipactor resonances were observed. The internal dark current was reduced to a comparatively low level, much smaller than in the previously studied, straight sidewall structure, in good agreement with simulations. The energy spectrum of the electrons colliding with the sidewall was measured using an isolated side dark current monitor and a bias voltage. As the conditioning progressed, the electron energy spectrum showed an increase in the concentration of lower energy electrons, also in good agreement with simulations. Studies of internal dark current may help to understand the rf conditioning and ultimate performance of high gradient accelerator structures.","Physics","linear accelerator; breakdown; multipactor discharge; high gradient",NA,"Haoran Xu, Michael A.

By arranging the acoustic sensor array in a coolant flow channel, it is possible to quickly detect a change in the local condition of the coolant with precise spatial resolution. This method is useful for monitoring superconducting magnets and power cables, especially those made with a cable-in-conduit-conductor (CICC) configuration.

"845",845,"Dynamic Phase Alignment in Inertial Alfven Turbulence","In weakly-collisional plasma environments with sufficiently low electron beta, Alfvenic turbulence transforms into inertial Alfvenic turbulence at scales below the electron skin-depth. We argue that, in inertial Alfvenic turbulence, both energy and generalized kinetic helicity exhibit direct cascades. We demonstrate that the two cascades are compatible due to the existence of a strong scale-dependence of the phase alignment angle between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with the phase alignment angle scaling as proportional to the perpendicular wavenumber to the power of -1. The kinetic and magnetic energy spectra scale as the perpendicular wavenumber to the power of -5/3 and -11/3, respectively. As a result of the dual direct cascade, the generalized-helicity spectrum scales as the perpendicular wavenumber to the power of -5/3, implying progressive balancing of the turbulence as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the sub-electron-skin-depth range. Turbulent eddies exhibit a phase-space anisotropy, with the parallel wavenumber scaling as the perpendicular wavenumber to the power of 5/3, consistent with critically-balanced inertial Alfven fluctuations. Our results may be applicable to a variety of geophysical, space, and astrophysical environments, including the Earth's magnetosheath and ionosphere, solar corona, non-relativistic pair plasmas, as well as to strongly rotating non-ionized fluids.","Physics","alfvenic turbulence, astrophysical plasma, critical balance, helicity, imbalanced turbulence, kinetic turbulence, solar flares, solar wind, turbulence amplitude, turbulence characteristics, turbulence spectrum",NA,"Lucio M.

By coupling these detectors with a custom PROTO-XRD x-ray source with interchangeable cathodes, accurate characterizations of Θ(E) for filters of varying materials and thicknesses have been obtained. The validity of the technique has been confirmed by accurately reproducing areal densities for high-purity filters with known x-ray transmission properties.

"856",856,"El Comercio Migrant Association Database","This dataset contains information from a corpus of several thousand advertisements published by migrant associations in the classifieds section of Peru's main daily paper, El Comercio (Lima), from 1906 to 1933. The associations recorded in the dataset were established by internal migrants living in Lima, Peru. Each association represented migrants from a specific region or town, generally in the Andean highland regions of Peru. Information is recorded in two spreadsheets: ""Associations"" and ""Articles."" The first contains information on the associations, and the second contains information on advertisements published in El Comercio by those associations. These announcements typically concerned upcoming and past meetings, elections and other association activities. In aggregate, the dataset reveals patterns in association activity that in turn illuminate the history of internal migration in early-20th century Peru.","Arts and Humanities; Social Sciences","history of Peru; history of Lima; internal migration; voluntary associations","2020-06-16","Ayme, Yesica                                                    Durston, Alan                                                    Molina, Eliezer                                                    Pareja, Roberto                                                    Tavera, Luis","Durston, Alan","Ayme, Yesica; Durston, Alan; Molina, Eliezer; Pareja, Roberto; Tavera, Luis, 2020, ""El Comercio Migrant Association Database"", https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/8IPTYQ, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V3, UNF:6:HplwHlDaTyeMNHnJ1/5aXA== [fileUNF]",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Harvard Dataverse"

"864",864,"Thiol-ene cross-linked alginate hydrogel encapsulation modulates the extracellular matrix of kidney organoids by reducing abnormal type 1a1 collagen deposition","Differentiated kidney organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells hold promise as a treatment for patients with kidney diseases. Before these organoids can be translated to the clinic, shortcomings regarding their cellular and extracellular compositions, and their developmental plateau need to be overcome. We performed a proteomic analysis on kidney organoids cultured for a prolonged culture time and we found a specific change in the extracellular matrix composition with increased expression of types 1a1, 2 and 6a1 collagen. Such an excessive accumulation of specific collagen types is a hallmark of renal fibrosis that causes a life-threatening pathological condition by compromising key functions of the human kidney. Here we hypothesized the need for a three-dimensional environment to grow the kidney organoids, which could better mimic the in vivo surroundings of the developing kidney than standard culture on an air–liquid interface. Encapsulating organoids for four days in a soft, thiol-ene cross-linked alginate hydrogel resulted in decreased type 1a1 collagen expression. Furthermore, the encapsulation did not result in any changes of organoid structural morphology. Using a biomaterial to modulate collagen expression allows for a prolonged kidney organoid culture in vitro and a reduction of abnormal type 1a1 collagen expression bringing kidney organoids closer to clinical application.

A team of three coders designated each of the 76 revolutions identified in the original ""Measuring Revolution"" dataset (Colgan 2012) as external or internal after consulting a range of primary and secondary sources. External revolutions are motivated primarily by animus against an outside entity, such as a former colonial power. Internal revolutions are motivated strictly by domestic grievances like corruption and political repression. Each of the 76 revolutions was evaluated by all three coders. Cases were independently assigned a final coding designation based on the majority coding designation for each case. The goal is to assess the effect of revolution subtype (external vs. internal) on the likelihood that the revolutionary state initiates militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) after its revolution. Researchers might also use this dataset to assess how a revolution's ideological subtype (external vs. internal) shapes other outcomes such as economic development or political institutions.

"881",881,"Replication Data for: Protecting the Vote? Peacekeeping Presence and the Risk of Electoral Violence","Democracy assistance, including the promotion of electoral security, is often a central component of contemporary peacekeeping operations. Preventing violence during post-conflict elections is critical for the war-to-democracy transition. Yet little is known about the role of peacekeepers in this effort. To fill this gap, this study provides the first comprehensive sub-national study of peacekeeping effectiveness in reducing the risk of electoral violence. It combines geo-referenced data on peacekeeping deployment across all multidimensional peacekeeping missions in Africa over the past two decades with fine-grained data on electoral violence. The analysis finds a negative association between peacekeeping presence and the risk of electoral violence. The relationship is of a similar magnitude in the pre- and post-election periods. However, the association is more strongly negative for violence perpetrated by non-state actors compared to violence perpetrated by government-affiliated actors. Analyses using two-way fixed-effects models and matching mitigate potential selection biases.","Social Sciences","Peacekeeping, United Nations, Electoral violence, Elections, Civil war","2021-06-22","Fjelde, Hanne (Uppsala University) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5251-7309                                                    Smidt, Hannah (University of Zurich) - ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4202-0037","Smidt, Hannah","Fjelde, Hanne; Smidt, Hannah, 2021, ""Replication Data for: Protecting the Vote?

Based on the single-tape critical-currents, a 40-tape (4-mm width) twisted stacked-tape cable (TSTC) conductor was experimentally evaluated at fields up to 17 T at 4.2 K. It was found that the Lorentz load degradation of the TSTC conductor was negligible at the end of a cyclic test. The TSTC cabling method has been considered to be suitable for developing a high-field high-current REBCO conductor for magnet applications as well as power transmission cables. A method to fabricate the inner legs of a D-shape toroidal field coil using a TSTC conductor has been discussed. This method allows the conductor to properly resist the transverse Lorentz load and mitigate ac loss issues by adopting a parallel-HTS-tape flat cable configuration where necessary.","Physics","coupling currents, fusion magnets, high field magnets, High temperature superconductor (HTS), HTS cable, stacked tape",NA,"Takayasu, Makoto; Chiesa, Luisa; Noyes, Patrick D.; Minervini, Joseph V.",NA,"Takayasu, Makoto; Chiesa, Luisa; Noyes, Patrick D.; Minervini, Joseph V., 2021, ""Investigation of HTS Twisted Stacked-Tape Cable (TSTC) Conductor for High-Field, High-Current Fusion Magnets"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IQT4PD, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:iCqI5AusnuSucn+2uXlC+w== [fileUNF]","c(""17ja089_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""17ja089_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""17ja089_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, 0, NA)","c(6, NA, NA)","c(15, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

In doing so, we drew on such sources as Constitute, UN Women’s Global Database of Constitutions, and other websites with archived texts of old constitutions, and then coded them for twelve issue areas related to women’s rights. In our dataset, we also include independent variables such as whether each African country experienced conflict, Freedom House democratic rating, region, former colonial power, whether a country is predominantly Muslim, and regional associations or unions in which countries hold membership. We grouped provisions that especially affect women and girls under the four broad themes of economic rights, political and legal rights including customary and family law, social rights and violence against women, and international treaties. These are selected based on how women’s rights activists in Africa have generally defined women’s rights. We recognize that this categorization may blur the many differences and nuances among those who identify as women. We also looked for gender-inclusive language. We searched the text of constitutions for relevant keywords in specific areas of provisions that fell into these categories and coded for the presence or absence of each type of provision (see codebook for elaboration of coding rules). We then analyzed the data for patterns of when and which African countries were incorporating what types of provisions relating to women’s rights.

Political economists try to uncover this by exploring voters' economic vulnerability, particularly the relationship between labor-market risk and redistribution preferences. Predominantly, however, such work imputes risk from occupational or sectoral characteristics. Due to within-occupational inequality in exposure to risk, considerable variation remains unexplored. I propose an individual-level, dynamic account of risk inferred from job tenure, contract type and expectations of job security. These aspects, importantly, account for individual variation in risk and the possibility that one's experience of risk may change across time. The results indicate the usefulness of this approach to risk in understanding changes in social spending preferences.","Social Sciences","Comparative Political Economy, Labor Market Risk, Redistribution Preferences, Public Opinion, Panel Data","2021-06-04","Pahontu, Raluca L.","Pahontu, Raluca L.","Pahontu, Raluca L., 2021, ""Replication Data for: Divisive Jobs: Three Facets of Risk, Precarity and Redistribution"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XBRMTW, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:IYwgt6FNt10vnFc61X1UOg== [fileUNF]","c(""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"", ""1-master.do"")","c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

The 13-item FACIT–Fatigue scale, a 7-item PROMIS® Fatigue Short-Form (PROMIS 7a), and the PROMIS® Fatigue computer adaptive test (CAT) were administered monthly online for six months. Reliability of measured change was defined, under a population mixed effects model, as the ratio of estimated systematic variance in rate-of-change to the estimated total variance of measured individual differences in rate-of-change. Precision of individual measured change, the standard error of measurement (SEM) of change, was given by the square root of the rate-of-change sampling variance. Linear and quadratic models were examined up to 3 and up to 6 months. A linear model for the reliability of measured change showed the following by 6 and by 3 months, respectively: PROMIS CAT (0.363 and 0.342); PROMIS SF (0.408 and 0.533); FACIT (0.459 and 0.473). Quadratic models offered no noteworthy improvement over linear models. Both reliability and precision results demonstrate the need to improve the measurement of intra-individual change. These results illustrate the challenge of reliably measuring individual change in fatigue with a level of confidence required for intervention.

A 3 m diameter vacuum vessel is lined with 36 rings of alternately oriented 4000 G samarium cobalt magnets, which create an axisymmetric multicusp that contains ∼14 m3of nearly magnetic field free plasma that is well confined and highly ionized (>50%). At present, 8 lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) cathodes and 10 molybdenum anodes are inserted into the vessel and biased up to 500 V, drawing 40 A each cathode, ionizing a low pressure Ar or He fill gas and heating it. Up to 100 kW of electron cyclotron heating power is planned for additional electron heating. The LaB6cathodes are positioned in the magnetized edge to drive toroidal rotation through J × B torques that propagate into the unmagnetized core plasma. Dynamo studies on MPDX require a high magnetic Reynolds number Rm > 1000, and an adjustable fluid Reynolds number 10 1). Initial results from MPDX are presented along with a 0-dimensional power and particle balance model to predict the viscosity and resistivity to achieve dynamo action.","Physics","cathodes, ECR heating, fusion, magnets, plasma astrophysics",NA,"Cooper, C.M.; Wallace, J.; Brookhart, M.; Clark, M.; Collins, C.; Ding, W.X.; Flanagan, K.; Khalzov, I.; Li, Y.; Milhone, J.; Nornberg, M.; Nonn, P.; Weisberg, D.; Whyte, D.G.; Zweibel, E.; Forest, C.B.",NA,"Cooper, C.M.; Wallace, J.; Brookhart, M.; Clark, M.; Collins, C.; Ding, W.X.; Flanagan, K.; Khalzov, I.; Li, Y.; Milhone, J.; Nornberg, M.; Nonn, P.; Weisberg, D.; Whyte, D.G.; Zweibel, E.; Forest, C.B., 2021, ""The Madison plasma dynamo experiment: A facility for studying laboratory plasma astrophysics"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QGEHZB, Harvard Dataverse, V1","c(""14ja088_archival_manuscript.pdf"", ""14ja088_archival_manuscript.pdf"")","c(0, NA)","c(NA, NA)","c(NA, NA)","Harvard Dataverse"

"918",918,"Replication Data for: When Do UN Peacekeeping Operations Implement Their Mandates?","Under what conditions do UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) implement the tasks in their mandates? Contemporary PKOs are expected to fulfil increasingly fragmented mandates in active conflict zones. We argue that these two trends-increasingly fragmented mandates, increasingly implemented amidst violence-exacerbate delegation and coordination problems that hinder PKOs from pursuing mandated tasks, potentially undermining their legitimacy in the eyes of the Security Council, troop-contributing countries, and host governments. Combining new datasets on PKO activities and mandates in Africa (1998-2016) and using instrumental variables and two-way fixed effects models, we find that mandate fragmentation is negatively correlated with mandate implementation, especially for peacebuilding tasks. Ongoing violence is also negatively correlated with implementation of peacebuilding tasks, but not with security tasks. We show that this is likely due to the offsetting effects of violence perpetrated by governments and rebels, as PKOs are better equipped to respond to the latter.

In this article, we shed light on gender inequality in ministerial selection processes by studying the duration from a minister's original appointment as a member of cabinet until he or she receives responsibility for a highly prestigious portfolio. We argue that the time it takes for ambitious politicians to prove themselves suitable for this type of cabinet position depends on their sex and the degree to which the policy area for which they are responsible reinforces stereotypical expectations about their personality traits. Empirical evidence from event history analysis of original data including detailed information on all ministerial careers in 27 European countries between 1990 to 2018 supports these propositions.

Preventing violence during post-conflict elections is critical for the war-to-democracy transition. Yet, we know little about the role of peacekeepers in this effort. To fill this gap, we provide the first comprehensive sub-national study of peacekeeping effectiveness in reducing the risk of electoral violence. We combine geo-referenced data on peacekeeping deployment across all multidimensional peacekeeping missions in Africa over the past two decades with fine-grained data on electoral violence. We find a negative association between peacekeeping presence and the risk of electoral violence. The relationship is of similar magnitude in the pre- and post-election period. However, the association is more strongly negative for violence perpetrated by non-state actors compared to violence perpetrated by government-affiliated actors. Analyses using two-way fixed effects models and matching mitigate potential selection biases.

"925",925,"Replication Data for: ""Does State Repression Spark Protests?""","Does physical surveillance hinder or foster anti-regime resistance? A common view holds that surveillance prevents resistance by providing regimes with high-quality intelligence on dissident networks, and by instilling fear in citizens. We contrast this view using formerly classified data from Communist Poland. We show that communities exposed to secret police officers were more likely to organize protests, but also engaged in less sabotage. To ensure that the correlation is causal, we use an instrumental variable strategy, which exploits the exogenous assignment of Catholic “spy priests” to local communities. To make sense of the unexpected finding, we draw on qualitative interviews and archival sources. We document that Poland’s comprehensive use of surveillance created widespread anger as well as an incentive for citizens to reveal their true loyalties, thus facilitating anti-regime collective action. Once on the streets, protesters refrained from sabotage to signal their political motivation to bystanders and authorities alike.

"933",933,"Replication Data for: Environmental Issue Linkage as an Electoral Advantage: The Case of NAFTA","Why would some legislators alter their votes on trade agreements in return for environmental side agreements that may be hard to enforce? While numerous studies have examined the effects of side agreements, few have evaluated their impact on legislators’ positions on a trade agreement over time. This paper examines the effects of the environmental side deal attached to NAFTA, with novel time-series survey data that captures the evolution of House members’ positions on NAFTA during discussion and finalization of the environmental side of the free trade agreement. I find that pro-environmental legislators in safe districts tended to withdraw their support for NAFTA once the side deal was agreed upon, whereas those in competitive districts stood their ground and increased their support in the final stage of voting. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, I find little evidence that the side deal assuaged legislators in import-competing districts. This article shows how the effectiveness of international institutions is moderated in important ways by electoral considerations.

Although scholars have studied Chinese elites' views on nuclear weapons, surprisingly little is known about the views of China's public. To understand Chinese public views on nuclear weapons, we conduct an online survey (N=1,066) of Chinese respondents. This is, to our knowledge, the first survey of Chinese public attitudes towards nuclear weapons. We find that although Chinese citizens view the possession of nuclear weapons as important for their country's security, they strongly oppose the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. We also provide respondents an opportunity to describe their views on nuclear weapons in their own words. Using computer-assisted text analysis, we assess patterns in these open-ended responses and compare across age groups. We find that younger respondents emphasize non-material factors such as having a greater voice internationally, whereas older respondents emphasize self-defense. Overall, this analysis sheds light on the public attitudes that may shape China's evolving approach to nuclear weapons.

"949",949,"Electrophysiological evidence for internalized representations of canonical finger number gestures and their facilitating effects on adults’ math verification performance.","Fingers facilitate number learning and arithmetic processing in early childhood. The current study investigated whether images of early-learned, culturally-typical (canonical), finger montring patterns presenting smaller (2,3,4) or larger (7,8,9) quantities still facilitate adults’ performance and neural processing in a math verification task. Twenty-eight adults verified solutions to simple addition problems that were shown in the form of canonical or non-canonical finger-number montring patterns while measuring Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). Results showed more accurate and faster sum verification when sum solutions were shown by canonical (versus non-canonical) finger patterns. Canonical finger montring patterns 2-4 led to faster responses independent of whether they presented correct or incorrect sum solutions and elicited an enhanced early right-parietal P2p response, whereas canonical configurations 7-9 only facilitated performance in correct sum solution trials without evoking P2p effects. The later central-parietal P3 was enhanced to all canonical finger patterns irrespective of numerical range. These combined results provide behavioral and brain evidence for canonical cardinal finger patterns still having facilitating effects on adults’ number processing. They further suggest that finger montring configurations of numbers 2-4 have stronger internalized associations with other magnitude representations, possibly established through their mediating role in the developmental phase in which children acquire the numerical meaning of the first four number symbols.","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-02-23","van den Berg, F.C.G.
