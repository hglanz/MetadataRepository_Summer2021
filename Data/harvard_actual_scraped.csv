"11","Replication Data for: The negative consequences of sports gambling opportunities on human capital formation: evidence from Spain","This repository contains the replication package--the instructions, data and code-- necessary to replicate the results presented in Espadafor & Martínez (2021). The proliferation of on-site betting shops has received enormous public attention, becoming one of the most alarming health policy issues in contemporary cities. However, there is little evidence on whether its growing presence nearby vulnerable populations produce social harm beyond its known adverse individual effects. This study provides new evidence on the negative societal effects of betting houses. Our research design takes advantage of a new wave of openings in Madrid (Spain), which created a sudden increase in the supply of on-site gambling. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that new betting houses decline nearby high schools' educational performance, especially in public schools in less advantaged areas. This effect is neither trivial nor diminishing with time. This evidence suggests that betting houses increase inequality of educational opportunities. The ubiquity of betting houses around vulnerable populations in multiple regions drives us to think that these findings have relevant policy implications for many countries currently designing policies tackling the increase of problem gambling.

"12","WX21","The Severe Weather and Society Survey (WX) was designed and administered by the Center for Risk and Crisis Management (CRCM) at the University of Oklahoma. This is the fifth survey in the annual series (see Silva et al. 2017, Silva et al. 2018, Silva et al. 2019, and Krocak et al. 2020 for information on WX17, WX18, WX19, and WX20). WX21 was fielded June 9 – July 17, 2021 using an online questionnaire that was completed by 1,550 US adults (age 18+) that were recruited from an Internet panel that matches the characteristics of the U.S. population as estimated in the U.S. Census. WX17 and WX18 were designed to establish baseline measures of the extent to which US adults receive, understand, and respond to severe weather forecasts and warnings; WX19 and WX20 were designed to continue and, in some cases, refine the measurement of these concepts. WX21 continues to measure these core concepts, giving us 5 years of consistent data to continue measuring change. Additionally, WX21 measured public trust in the National Weather Service (NWS), extreme weather and climate risk perceptions, risk literacy, interpretations of probabilistic language, and interpretation of longer-range severe weather forecasts (like those from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center).","Social Sciences",NA,"2021-07-08","Ripberger, Joseph (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Krocak, Makenzie (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Silva, Carol (University of Oklahoma)                                                    Jenkins-Smith, Hank (University of Oklahoma)","Krocak, Makenzie","Ripberger, Joseph; Krocak, Makenzie; Silva, Carol; Jenkins-Smith, Hank, 2021, ""WX21"", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QYZLSO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:Z2TF/SuLbAgTzrdUBe1+rw== [fileUNF]","c(""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"", ""WX21 Instrument.pdf"")","c(1, 0, 0, NA)","c(212, NA, NA, NA)","c(1550, NA, NA, NA)"

"21","Replication Data for: The Importance of Correct Measurement: A Response to Palmer, et al","Palmer, D’Orazio, Kenwick, and McManus (PDKM) review a minority of changes we made to the CoW MID data, agree with most of those changes, but then argue that no scientific findings will be influenced by these or the thousands of changed values they ignore. We respond in two ways. First, we point out that principles of good science dictate that we discard dispute cases that either cannot be substantiated by the historical record or that do not meet dataset coding rules; we also discuss the ten-thousand-plus changed values PDKM still have not examined. Second, contrary to PDKM, we demonstrate how data differences greatly affect previous studies by returning again to the replications. There were substantial errors in both of PDKM’s replications, and these errors led them to incorrect inferences.

"22","Replication Data for: Updating the Militarized Interstate Dispute Data: A Response to Gibler, Miller, and Little","In a recent article, Gibler, Miller, and Little (2016) (GML) conduct an extensive review of the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data between the years 1816 and 2001, highlighting possible inaccuracies and recommending a substantial number of changes to the data. They contend that, in several instances, analyses with their revised data lead to substantively different inferences. Here, we review GML's MID drop and merge recommendations and reevaluate the substantive impact of their changes. We are in agreement with about 76 percent of the recommended drops and merges. However, we find that some of the purported overturned findings in GML's replications are not due to their data, but rather to the strategies they employ for replication. We reexamine these findings and conclude that the remaining differences in inference stemming from the variations in the MID data are rare and modest in scope.

"23","The Effect of Core Values on Support for Electoral Reform: Evidence from Two Survey Experiments","A central tenet in the electoral systems subfield is that parties seek desired outcomes via the strategic adoption of electoral rules. Such partisan self-interest, however, is merely one explanation for reform: a second is that an actor may attempt to maximize her core values, which constitute her perception of the ‘common good.’ Although the extant literature has demonstrated the motivational power of core values, their effect on electoral rule choice has not been tested. Using a factorial experimental design that manipulates the partisan- and values-implications of a fictitious reform proposal, I find evidence in favor of core values: not only do they have an effect net of partisan concerns, but they also attenuate the effect of partisan self-interest when the two predispositions countervail. The results provide evidence that partisan self-interest offers an incomplete picture: actors hold—and pursue through electoral reform—objectives that are not immediately partisan in nature.
