"1",1,"Birth weight associations with DNA methylation differences in an adult population","Data Madden, Rebecca AMcCartney, Daniel LHillary, Robert FBermingham, Mairead LRawlik, KonradMorris, Stewart WCampbell, ArchiePorteous, David JDeary, Ian JEvans, Kathryn LHafferty, JonathanMcIntosh, Andrew MMarioni, Riccardo E","2020-10-20","The Developmental Origins Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory predicts that prenatal and early life events shape adult health outcomes. Birth weight is a useful indicator of the foetal experience, and has been associated with multiple adult health outcomes. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one plausible mechanism behind the relationship of birth weight to adult health. Through data linkage between Generation Scotland and historic Scottish birth cohorts, and birth records held through the NHS Information and Statistics Division, a sample of 1,757 individuals with available birth weight and DNAm data was derived. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed in two independently generated DNAm subgroups (nSet 1=1, 395, nSet2=362), relating adult DNAm from whole blood to birth weight. Meta-analysis yielded one genome-wide significant CpG site (p=5.97x10-9), cg00966482. There was minimal evidence for attenuation of the effect sizes for the lead loci upon adjustment for numerous potential confounder variables (body mass index, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status). Associations between birth weight and epigenetic measures of biological age were also assessed. Associations between lower birth weight and higher Grim Age acceleration (p(FDR)=0.0036) and shorter DNAm-derived telomere length (p(FDR)=0.0017) are described, although results for three other epigenetic clocks were null. Our results provide support for an association between birth weight and DNAm both locally at individual CpG sites and globally via biological ageing estimates.","United States","Madden, Rebecca A; McCartney, Daniel L; Hillary, Robert F; Bermingham, Mairead L; Rawlik, Konrad; Morris, Stewart W; Campbell, Archie; Porteous, David J; Deary, Ian J; Evans, Kathryn L; Hafferty, Jonathan; McIntosh, Andrew M; Marioni, Riccardo E.

Neocortical regions show signatures of expression of individual proteins, protein complexes, biochemical and metabolic pathways.

Integrating large-scale GWAS with regional proteome data identifies the same cortical region for smoking behavior as found with fMRI data.

Because Vm also plays a role in signal transduction, measuring it is of great interest. Over the years, a variety of techniques have been developed for the purpose. In bacteria, given their small size, Nernstian membrane voltage probes are arguably the favorite strategy, and their cytoplasmic accumulation depends on Vm according to the Nernst equation. However, a careful calibration of Nernstian probes that takes into account the tradeoffs between the ease with which the signal from the dye is observed and the dyes’ interactions with cellular physiology is rarely performed. Here, we use a mathematical model to understand such tradeoffs and apply the results to assess the applicability of the Thioflavin T dye as a Vm sensor in Escherichia coli. We identify the conditions in which the dye turns from a Vm probe into an actuator and, based on the model and experimental results, propose a general workflow for the characterization of Nernstian dye candidates.","United States","Mancini, Leonardo; Terradot, Guillaume; Tian, Tian; Pu, YingYing; Li, YingXing; Lo, Chien-Jung; Bai, Fan; Pilizota, Teuta.

We perform experiments on these phenomena using Spheriglass, an industrially-realistic model powder. Drawing on recent advances in understanding friction-induced shear thickening and jamming in suspensions, we offer a unified description of granulation and suspension rheology. A ‘liquid incorporation phase diagram’ explains the existence of permanent and transient granules and the increase of granule size with liquid content.

The project aimed to understand the interplay between traditional Dinka musical forms and the Dinka language (which distinguishes words not just by different consonants and vowels but also by means of rhythm, pitch and voice quality), and to learn more about the way the song tradition responded to the disruptions of the long Sudanese civil war. In this context, we aimed to record a large collection of Dinka songs for preservation in a long-term sound archive. This collection is the result of that effort. It presents song material from 36 Dinka singers and groups of singers. Further details can be found in the readme file.

Cultivation (agriculture) is a major activity for the Shilluk people. Almost all the Shilluk land is fertile with good rain fall. Villagers do primitive farming using very simple hand tools. They produce a small amount of dura that is sometimes less than what they need. Only a few people produce more than what they need and exchange it for cows. Shilluk cultivate three types of dura: 1. ‘Lwallì’ red dura which is cultivated near the village. It takes three months to ripen. So, people start eating it in August.  The new grain, once dry, is planted in its turn, yielding a harvest in December. So, some people cultivate the red dura twice a year. In some areas, red dura and maize are now cultivated far inland because the children who would look after the cows go to schools. 2. ‘Thurø’ brown dura is cultivated in the forest. It is harvested in October. 3. ‘Ágono’ yellow dura is cultivated far from the village. It ripens very late in December. Usually people start planting lwalli and then go to plant thuro or agono.","United States","Gwado Ayoker, Otto; Remijsen, Bert. (2014). OttoGwadoAyoker_Cultivation, 2014 [sound].

We provide the raw images and analysis files. Due to University of Edinburgh DataShare space constraints, we cannot upload the processed images but can share them upon request (email tara.spires-jones@ed.ac.uk). # Paper abstract: # Synaptic dysfunction and loss is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with increasing evidence implicating neuropathological tau protein in this process. Despite the knowledge that tau spreads through defined synaptic circuits, it is currently unknown whether synapse loss occurs before the accumulation of tau or as a consequence. To address this, we have used array tomography to examine an rTgTauEC mouse model expressing a P301L human tau transgene and a transgene labelling cytoplasm red (tdTomato) and presynaptic terminals green (Synaptophysin-EGFP). All transgenes are restricted primarily to the entorhinal cortex using the neuropsin promotor to drive tTA expression. It has previously been shown that rTgTauEC mice exhibit neuronal loss in the entorhinal cortex and synapse density loss in the middle molecular layer (MML) of the dentate gyrus at 24 months of age. Here we observed the density of tau-expressing and total pre synapses, and the spread of tau into the postsynapse in the MML of 3-6, 9 and 18 months old red-green-rTgTauEC mice. We observe no loss of synapse density in the MML up to 18 months even in axons expressing tau. Despite the maintenance of synapse density, we see spread of human tau from presynaptic terminals to postsynaptic compartments in the MML at very early ages, indicating that the spread of tau through neural circuits is not due to the degeneration of axon terminals and is an early feature of the disease process.","United States","Spires-Jones, Tara; Pickett, Eleanor.
