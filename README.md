# MetaData Repository
## Summer Research, 2021

#### _Students:_ Sucheen Sundaram

#### _Faculty advisors:_ Hunter Glanz

### Objective

The objective of this summer research is to develop, expand, and polish a repository for metadata for broadly useful datasets.

### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository which contains the following:**

1.  An R project which contains all files relevant to the metadata repository.

2.  A log of hours spent on the summer research by the student, which includes date, hours, and activity summary.

3.  A presentation to the Statistics Department.

4.  A presentation at the CSM annual research conference.

5.  A manuscript to submit to a journal to be determined.

### Specific Aims

**1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.**

  * Karl Broman's [github tutorial](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

  * Jenny Bryan's [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/).
  
  * Also check out [using version control with RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) and [this video on Git and RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).


**2.  Adhere to good programming practices.**
  
  * Write all R code according to [Hadley Wickam's Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
  
  * Use the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) for an additional reference.
  
  * Use Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book as a reference (Ch19 also discusses functions).
  
  
  **3.  Scrape various websites and use various website APIs to collect metadata.**  

  *  Harvard's Dataverse
  
  *  Data Dryad ([https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdryad/rdryad.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdryad/rdryad.pdf))([https://datadryad.org/api/v2/docs/](https://datadryad.org/api/v2/docs/))
  
  *  UCI Machine Learning Repository
  *  Kaggle ([https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle))

   **4.  Organize metadata into single dataset**
  
  *  Establish full set of variables/columns/features in metadata.
  
  *  Establish best form for metadata dataset.
  *  Metadata Target Fields/Observed Fields: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CidGQw74Y1an9Z5JuayYCFkQor5zSMwDZR952OuQE2g/edit?usp=sharing
  
  
  **5. Understand/Learn about data storage, curation, and indexing.**
